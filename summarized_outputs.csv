"In 2015, Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae; Flavivirus) emerged in the Americas, causing millions of infections in dozens of countries. The rapid spread of the virus and the association with disease outcomes such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly make understanding transmission dynamics essential. Currently, there are no reports of vector competence (VC) of American mosquitoes for ZIKV isolates from the Americas. Further, it is not clear whether ZIKV strains from other genetic lineages can be transmitted by American Aedes aegypti populations, and whether the scope of the current epidemic is in part facilitated by viral factors such as enhanced replicative fitness or increased vector competence. Therefore, we characterized replication of three ZIKV strains, one from each of the three phylogenetic clades in several cell lines and assessed their abilities to be transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Additionally, laboratory colonies of different Culex spp. were infected with an American outbreak strain of ZIKV to assess VC. Replication rates were variable and depended on virus strain, cell line and MOI. African strains used in this study outcompeted the American strain in vitro in both mammalian and mosquito cell culture. West and East African strains of ZIKV tested here were more efficiently transmitted by Ae. aegypti from Mexico than was the currently circulating American strain of the Asian lineage. Long-established laboratory colonies of Culex mosquitoes were not efficient ZIKV vectors. These data demonstrate the capacity for additional ZIKV strains to infect and replicate in American Aedes mosquitoes and suggest that neither enhanced virus replicative fitness nor virus adaptation to local vector mosquitoes seems likely to explain the extent and intensity of ZIKV transmission in the Americas.","The mechanisms contributing to the explosive nature of the current ZIKV outbreak in the Americas are poorly understood. Therefore, we characterized the replication of three strains, one from each phylogenetic clade of ZIKV and evaluated virus strain differences in transmission efficiency by American mosquitoes. Our results suggest that the strain currently circulating in the Americas does not have unusually high infectivity for American Ae. aegypti as compared to the African strains used in this study. Colonized Culex mosquitoes were inefficient vectors. In vitro data suggested slower replication and decreased fitness for the currently circulating American strain compared to African strains isolated decades ago. Therefore, viral adaptation to local mosquitoes does not appear, at present, to be driving the current ZIKV outbreak in the Americas.","we characterized replication of three ZIKV strains, one from each of the three phylogenetic clades in several cell lines and assessed their ability to be transmitted by American Aedes aegypti mosquitoes . furthermore, laboratory colonies of different Culex spp. were infected with an American outbreak strain of Zika virus (Zika virus; Flaviviridae; Flavivirus) to assess vector competence (VC) . a total of 3 strains of ZIkV tested here were more efficiently transmitted by the American strain in vitro in both mammalian and mosquito cell culture than was the currently "
"Most epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) quantify DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral tissues such as whole blood to identify positions in the genome where variation is statistically associated with a trait or exposure. As whole blood comprises a mix of cell types, it is unclear whether trait-associated DNAm variation is specific to an individual cellular population. We collected three peripheral tissues (whole blood, buccal epithelial and nasal epithelial cells) from thirty individuals. Whole blood samples were subsequently processed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify five constituent cell-types (monocytes, granulocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells) . DNAm was profiled in all eight sample-types from each individual using the Illumina EPIC array. We identified significant differences in both the level and variability of DNAm between different sample types, and DNAm data-derived estimates of age and smoking were found to differ dramatically across sample types from the same individual. We found that for the majority of loci variation in DNAm in individual blood cell types was only weakly predictive of variance in DNAm measured in whole blood, although the proportion of variance explained was greater than that explained by either buccal or nasal epithelial samples. Covariation across sample types was much higher for DNAm sites influenced by genetic factors. Overall, we observe that DNAm variation in whole blood is additively influenced by a combination of the major blood cell types. For a subset of sites, however, variable DNAm detected in whole blood can be attributed to variation in a single blood cell type providing potential mechanistic insight about EWAS findings. Our results suggest that associations between whole blood DNAm and traits or exposures reflect differences in multiple cell types and our data will facilitate the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology.","As epigenetic variation is cell-type specific, an ongoing challenge in epigenetic epidemiology is how to interpret studies performed using bulk tissue ( for example, whole blood) which comprises a mix of different cell types. In this study, we identified major differences in DNA methylation ( DNAm) across multiple peripheral tissues and different blood cell types, with each sample type being characterized by a unique signature across multiple genomic loci. We demonstrate how these differences influence commonly used prediction scores derived from DNAm data for age and tobacco smoking, with estimates for the same individual being highly variable across tissues and cell types. Our results enabled us to assess the extent to which variable DNAm in each individual blood cell type relates to variation measured in whole blood. We found that although individual blood cell types predict more of the variation in DNAm in whole blood compared to buccal and nasal epithelial cells, the actual proportion of variance explained is relatively small, except for at sites where DNAm is under genetic control. Our data indicate that for most sites variation in multiple blood cell types additively combines to drive variation in DNAm measured in whole blood. Of note, for a subset of sites, variation in DNAm detected in whole blood can be attributed to a specific blood cell type, potentially facilitating the interpretation of EWAS findings.","epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) quantify DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral tissues such as whole blood to identify positions in the genome where variation is statistically associated with a trait or exposure . we identified significant differences in both the level and variability of DNAm between different sample types , and DNAm data-derived estimates of age and smoking were found to differ dramatically across sample types from the same individual . our results suggest that associations between whole blood DNAm and traits or exposures reflect differences in multiple cell types and our data will facilitate the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology ."
"Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwater ecosystems are almost universally predicted to increase with climate warming. Glacier-fed rivers and lakes, however, differ critically from those in nonglacierized catchments in that they receive little terrestrial input of organic matter for decomposition and CO2 production, and transport large quantities of easily mobilized comminuted sediments available for carbonate and silicate weathering reactions that can consume atmospheric CO2. We used a whole-watershed approach, integrating concepts from glaciology and limnology, to conclusively show that certain glacier-fed freshwater ecosystems are important and previously overlooked annual CO2 sinks due to the overwhelming influence of these weathering reactions. Using the glacierized Lake Hazen watershed (Nunavut, Canada, 82degN) as a model system, we found that weathering reactions in the glacial rivers actively consumed CO2 up to 42 km downstream of glaciers, and cumulatively transformed the High Arctic's most voluminous lake into an important CO2 sink. In conjunction with data collected at other proglacial freshwater sites in Greenland and the Canadian Rockies, we suggest that CO2 consumption in proglacial freshwaters due to glacial melt-enhanced weathering is likely a globally relevant phenomenon, with potentially important implications for regional annual carbon budgets in glacierized watersheds.","Significance Glacier melt is one of the most dramatic consequences of climate change in high-latitude and high-altitude environments. As meltwaters move across poorly consolidated landscapes, they transport vast quantities of highly reactive comminuted sediments prone to chemical weathering reactions that may consume atmospheric CO2. Using a whole watershed approach in the Canadian High Arctic, combined with additional dissolved CO2 measurements in glacial rivers in Greenland and the Canadian Rockies, we show that certain glacier-fed freshwater ecosystems are significant and previously unrecognized annual CO2 sinks due to chemical weathering. As many of the world's rivers originate from glacial headwaters, we highlight the potential importance of this process for contemporary regional carbon budgets in rapidly changing high-latitude and high-altitude watersheds.","carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwater ecosystems are almost universally predicted to increase with climate warming . we used a whole-watershed approach to conclusively show that certain glacier-fed fishes are important and previously overlooked annual CO2 sinks due to the overwhelming influence of these weathering reactions . in conjunction with data collected at other proglacial freshwater sites in Greenland and the Canadian Rockies, we suggest that CO2 consumption in a glacierized lake is likely a globally relevant phenomenon , with potentially important implications for regional annual carbon budgets ."
"Microfluidic water-in-oil droplets that serve as separate, chemically isolated compartments can be applied for single-cell analysis; however, to investigate encapsulated cells effectively over prolonged time periods, an array of droplets must remain stationary on a versatile substrate for optimal cell compatibility. We present here a platform of unique geometry and substrate versatility that generates a stationary nanodroplet array by using wells branching off a main microfluidic channel. These droplets are confined by multiple sides of a nanowell and are in direct contact with a biocompatible substrate of choice. The device is operated by a unique and reversed loading procedure that eliminates the need for fine pressure control or external tubing. Fluorocarbon oil isolates the droplets and provides soluble oxygen for the cells. By using this approach, the metabolic activity of single adherent cells was monitored continuously over time, and the concentration of viable pathogens in blood-derived samples was determined directly by measuring the number of colony-formed droplets. The method is simple to operate, requires a few microliters of reagent volume, is portable, is reusable, and allows for cell retrieval. This technology may be particularly useful for multiplexed assays for which prolonged and simultaneous visual inspection of many isolated single adherent or nonadherent cells is required.","Significance There is a substantial need for single-cell platforms in which each cell is chemically isolated in its own microenvironment and a lack of such platforms that support adherent cells. We present here a method that generates stationary nanoliter droplet arrays on a substrate of choice and supports long-term incubation and interrogation of single cells. We demonstrate the encapsulation of single human dermal fibroblast cells and their substrate attachment, viability, and proliferation, and show they can be retrieved and interfaced to standard cell culturing techniques. We also demonstrate a single-cell metabolic assay and track it over selected groups of indexed traps. The device does not require external equipment or machinery, making it available for point-of-care applications.","we present here a platform of unique geometry and substrate versatility that generates a stationary nanodroplet array by using wells branching off a main microfluidic channel . the device is operated by a unique and reversed loading procedure that eliminates the need for fine pressure control or external tubing . by using this approach, the metabolic activity of single adherent cells was monitored continuously over time , and the concentration of viable pathogens in blood-derived samples was determined directly by measuring the number of colony-formed droplets . this method is simple to operate, requires a few microliters of reagent volume , is portable, is reusable, and allows for cell"
"Fluoroquinolones are the most commonly used group of antimicrobials for the treatment of enteric fever, but no direct comparison between two fluoroquinolones has been performed in a large randomised trial. An open-label randomized trial was conducted to investigate whether gatifloxacin is more effective than ofloxacin in the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever caused by nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A. Adults and children clinically diagnosed with uncomplicated enteric fever were enrolled in the study to receive gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) in a single dose or ofloxacin (20 mg/kg/day) in two divided doses for 7 days. Patients were followed for six months. The primary outcome was treatment failure in patients infected with nalidixic acid resistant isolates. 627 patients with a median age of 17 (IQR 9-23) years were randomised. Of the 218 patients with culture confirmed enteric fever, 170 patients were infected with nalidixic acid-resistant isolates. In the ofloxacin group, 6 out of 83 patients had treatment failure compared to 5 out of 87 in the gatifloxacin group (hazard ratio [HR] of time to failure 0. 81, 95% CI 0. 25 to 2. 65, p = 0. 73) . The median time to fever clearance was 4. 70 days (IQR 2. 98-5. 90) in the ofloxacin group versus 3. 31 days (IQR 2. 29-4. 75) in the gatifloxacin group (HR = 1. 59, 95% CI 1. 16 to 2. 18, p = 0. 004) . The results in all blood culture-confirmed patients and all randomized patients were comparable. Gatifloxacin was not superior to ofloxacin in preventing failure, but use of gatifloxacin did result in more prompt fever clearance time compared to ofloxacin. Trial registration: ISRCTN 63006567","Enteric fever, which comprises of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, is common in many developing countries. It is also sometimes seen in the Western world in returning travellers. This present study of uncomplicated enteric fever in an outpatient setting in a hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal compared the newer gatifloxacin with the widely-used ofloxacin ( two drugs of the fluroquinolone class) in the treatment of this illness. Although fluroquinolones are commonly considered the main group of drugs in the treatment of enteric fever, there have not been comparisons of efficacy between two drugs in this same class in the treatment of enteric fever. Furthermore, certain strains of enteric fever organism called nalidixic-acid resistant strains are proving very difficult to treat in both the local population and the Western travellers. The study focused primarily on the efficacy of the 2 drugs against these particular strains. The results revealed that both drugs were effective but gatifloxacin decreased the patient's fever more rapidly than ofloxacin. Dysglycemia was noted in a 35-year-old woman taking gatifloxacin who did not disclose a pre-existing diagnosis of diabetes at time of enrollment, but not in any other healthy child or young adult.","background : fluoroquinolones are the most commonly used group of antimicrobials for the treatment of enteric fever , but no direct comparison between two fluorioquinonones has been performed in a large randomised trial.materials and methods : 627 patients with a median age of 17 (IQR 9-23) years were randomised . the primary outcome was treatment failure in patients infected with nalidixic acid-resistant isolates.results:of the 218 patients with culture confirmed enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A were enrolled in the study to receive gatifloxacin (10"
"Phyllotaxis, the distribution of organs such as leaves and flowers on their support, is a key attribute of plant architecture. The geometric regularity of phyllotaxis has attracted multidisciplinary interest for centuries, resulting in an understanding of the patterns in the model plants Arabidopsis and tomato down to the molecular level. Nevertheless, the iconic example of phyllotaxis, the arrangement of individual florets into spirals in the heads of the daisy family of plants (Asteraceae) , has not been fully explained. We integrate experimental data and computational models to explain phyllotaxis in Gerbera hybrida. We show that phyllotactic patterning in gerbera is governed by changes in the size of the morphogenetically active zone coordinated with the growth of the head. The dynamics of these changes divides the patterning process into three phases: the development of an approximately circular pattern with a Fibonacci number of primordia near the head rim, its gradual transition to a zigzag pattern, and the development of a spiral pattern that fills the head on the template of this zigzag pattern. Fibonacci spiral numbers arise due to the intercalary insertion and lateral displacement of incipient primordia in the first phase. Our results demonstrate the essential role of the growth and active zone dynamics in the patterning of flower heads.","Significance Flower heads, such as those of gerbera or sunflower, comprise hundreds of bracts and florets. They are organized into conspicuous spiral patterns with intriguing mathematical properties: For example, the numbers of left- and right-winding spirals are typically consecutive Fibonacci numbers. We examined auxin reporter lines of gerbera and combined diverse microscopy and modeling techniques to understand how these patterns develop. The critical process is the early patterning of bracts, which emerge in a specific order and guide the placement of the subsequent bracts and florets. This process, controlled by expansion and contraction of the organogenetic zone during head growth, is different from the extensively studied phyllotactic patterning in the model plants Arabidopsis and tomato.","phyllotactic patterning in gerbera hybrida is governed by changes in the size of the morphogenetically active zone coordinated with the growth of the head . the dynamics of these changes divides the patterning process into three phases : the development of an approximately circular pattern with a Fibonacci number of primordia near the head head rim , its gradual transition to a zigzag pattern , and the developing of a spiral pattern that fills the head on the template of this . we demonstrate the essential role of the growth and active zone dynamics in patterning of flower heads ."
"Background This is an update of the original Cochrane review entitled Lamotrigine for acute and chronic pain published in Issue 2, 2007, and updated in Issue 2, 2011. Some antiepileptic medicines have a place in the treatment of neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). This updated review adds no new additional studies looking at evidence for lamotrigine as an effective treatment for chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. The update uses higher standards of evidence than previously. Objectives To assess the analgesic efficacy of lamotrigine in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and to evaluate adverse effects reported in the studies. Search methods We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lamotrigine for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia (including cancer pain) from MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We ran searches for the original review in 2006, in 2011 for the first update, and subsequent searches in August 2013 for this update. We sought additional studies from the reference lists of the retrieved papers. The original review and first update included acute pain, but no acute pain studies were identified. Selection criteria RCTs investigating the use of lamotrigine (any dose, by any route, and for any study duration) for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. Assessment of pain intensity or pain relief, or both, using validated scales. Participants were adults aged 18 and over. We included only full journal publication articles. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. The first tier used data where studies reported the outcome of at least 50% pain reduction from baseline, lasted at least eight weeks, had a parallel group design, included 200 or more participants in the comparison, and reported an intention-to-treat analysis. First-tier studies did not use last observation carried forward (LOCF) or other imputational methods for dropouts. The second tier used data that failed to meet this standard and second-tier results were therefore subject to potential bias. Main results Twelve included studies in 11 publications (1511 participants), all with chronic neuropathic pain: central post-stroke pain (1), chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (1), diabetic neuropathy (4), HIV-related neuropathy (2), mixed neuropathic pain (2), spinal cord injury-related pain (1), and trigeminal neuralgia (1). We did not identify any additional studies. Participants were aged between 26 and 77 years. Study duration was two weeks in one study and at least six weeks in the remainder; eight were of eight-week duration or longer. No study provided first-tier evidence for an efficacy outcome. There was no convincing evidence that lamotrigine is effective in treating neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia at doses of 200 mg to 400 mg daily. Almost 10% of participants taking lamotrigine reported a skin rash. Authors' conclusions Large, high-quality, long-duration studies reporting clinically useful levels of pain relief for individual participants provided no convincing evidence that lamotrigine is effective in treating neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia at doses of about 200 to 400 mg daily. Given the availability of more effective treatments including antiepileptics and antidepressant medicines, lamotrigine does not have a significant place in therapy based on the available evidence. The adverse effect profile of lamotrigine is also of concern.","Lamotrigine (an antiepileptic drug) for chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (a fall, or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines than pain from damaged tissue. Medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen are not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat depression or epilepsy can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain. Our understanding of fibromyalgia (a condition of persistent, widespread pain and tenderness, sleep problems, and fatigue) is lacking, but fibromyalgia can respond to the same medicines as neuropathic pain. Lamotrigine is a medicine used to treat epilepsy, and so might be a useful medicine for neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. On 26 November 2013 we performed searches to look for clinical trials where lamotrigine was used to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. We found 12 studies of reasonable quality that tested lamotrigine against placebo for a number of weeks. Almost half of the 1511 people in the studies had painful limbs because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes, and seven different painful neuropathic conditions were examined. No studies looked at fibromyalgia. Lamotrigine did not help the pain, and was no different from placebo except in causing more side effects. Adverse events were more frequent with lamotrigine than placebo, with rash in 1 person in 27.","objectiveto assess the analgesic efficacy of lamotrigine in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, and to evaluate adverse effects reported in the studies.materials and methodswe searched for the original review in 2006, in 2011 for the first update, and subsequent searches in August 2013 for this update.resultswe identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of the drug (any dose, by any route, and for any study duration) for the treatment (including cancer pain) from MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL).research methodswe identified"
"Background The sustained interest in electronic assistive technology in dementia care has been fuelled by the urgent need to develop useful approaches to help support people with dementia at home. Also the low costs and wide availability of electronic devices make it more feasible to use electronic devices for the benefit of disabled persons. Information Communication Technology (ICT) devices designed to support people with dementia are usually referred to as Assistive Technology (AT) or Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT). By using AT in this review we refer to electronic assistive devices. A range of AT devices has been developed to support people with dementia and their carers to manage their daily activities and to enhance safety, for example electronic pill boxes, picture phones, or mobile tracking devices. Many are commercially available. However, the usefulness and user-friendliness of these devices are often poorly evaluated. Although reviews of (electronic) memory aids do exist, a systematic review of studies focusing on the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia is lacking. Such a review would guide people with dementia and their informal and professional carers in selecting appropriate AT devices. Objectives Primary objective To assess the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia in terms of daily performance of personal and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), level of dependency, and admission to long-term care. Secondary objective To assess the impact of AT on: users (autonomy, usefulness and user-friendliness, adoption of AT); cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms; need for informal and formal care; perceived quality of life; informal carer burden, self-esteem and feelings of competence; formal carer work satisfaction, workload and feelings of competence; and adverse events. Search methods We searched ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), on 10 November 2016. ALOIS is maintained by the Information Specialists of the CDCIG and contains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treatment and cognitive enhancement in healthy people. We also searched the following list of databases, adapting the search strategy as necessary: Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Databases, up to May 2016; The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies; DBLP Computer Science Bibliography; HCI Bibliography: Human-Computer Interaction Resources; and AgeInfo, all to June 2016; PiCarta; Inspec; Springer Link Lecture Notes; Social Care Online; and IEEE Computer Society Digital Library, all to October 2016; J-STAGE: Japan Science and Technology Information Aggregator, Electronic; and Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library (NCSTRL), both to November 2016; Computing Research Repository (CoRR) up to December 2016; and OT seeker; and ADEAR, both to February 2017. In addition, we searched Google Scholar and OpenSIGLE for grey literature. Selection criteria We intended to review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clustered randomised trials with blinded assessment of outcomes that evaluated an electronic assistive device used with the single aim of supporting memory function in people diagnosed with dementia. The control interventions could either be 'care (or treatment) as usual' or non-technological psychosocial interventions (including interventions that use non-electronic assistive devices) also specifically aimed at supporting memory. Outcome measures included activities of daily living, level of dependency, clinical and care-related outcomes (for example admission to long-term care), perceived quality of life and well-being, and adverse events resulting from the use of AT; as well as the effects of AT on carers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts identified by the search. Main results We identified no studies which met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the current lack of high-quality evidence to determine whether AT is effective in supporting people with dementia to manage their memory problems.","Assistive technology for memory support in dementia Review question We wanted to find out from a review of the evidence whether Assistive Technology can help people with dementia overcome some of the effects of their memory problems. Background Dementia causes memory problems that make it increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities, for example cooking, remembering appointments, taking medication. The memory problems experienced can have a large negative impact on people with dementia, and may cause confusion, anxiety, embarrassment, or depression. This decreasing ability to carry out daily activities can cause stress to family carers who worry about the person's safety and well-being. A range of electronic devices -- most commonly referred to as Assistive Technology (AT - used throughout this review), and sometimes as Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT) -- have been developed to support people with dementia. The devices can be divided into four categories offering support with general and personal information (e.g. digital social charts); practical support with problems caused by the symptoms of dementia, especially memory loss (e.g. electronic pill dispenser boxes, electronic diaries); support with social contact and company (e.g. picture phones, interactive 'pet' robots); and support with perceived risks to health and safety (e.g. tracking devices, fall sensors). In this review, we concentrated on devices intended to help people manage their memory problems. We wanted to find our whether AT is effective at helping people who have memory problems due to dementia carry out their daily activities, and whether it makes them less dependent on others, improves their quality of life or has an effect on admission to institutional care. We also wanted to find out if it has any impact on family and paid carers. Study characteristics We searched systematically for all research studies that had evaluated AT by allocating people with dementia at random to an AT device or to 'usual care' or a non-technological solution to support memory and then comparing outcomes. Our search included all the evidence available up to 10 November 2016. Key results We found no studies that met our criteria. Quality of the evidence The review identified a lot of literature on the development of AT, including reports of researchers working with people with dementia and their carers to determine the type and design of AT which might be useful. There was also a lot of guidance written for health professionals and potential users of AT. We found some small studies that had tested the effectiveness of selected AT devices, but the methods used were not of a high enough quality to meet the review criteria. Therefore we cannot be sure at the moment whether or not AT can really help people with dementia manage their memory problems. We believe more research should be done in this area.","purposeto assess the efficacy of assistive technology (AT) for memory support in people with dementia in terms of daily performance of personal and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) and level of dependency , and admission to long-term care.materials and methodswe searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 10 November 2016.resultswe reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clustered randomised trials with blinded assessment of outcomes that evaluated an electronic assistive device used with the single aim of supporting memory function in people diagnosed with dementia.conclusionsa systematic review of studies focusing on"
"Once considered a phenotypically monomorphic bacterium, there is a growing body of work demonstrating heterogeneity among Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains in clinically relevant characteristics, including virulence and response to antibiotics. However, the genetic and molecular basis for most phenotypic differences among Mtb strains remains unknown. To investigate the basis of strain variation in Mtb, we performed genome-wide transposon mutagenesis coupled with next-generation sequencing (TnSeq) for a panel of Mtb clinical isolates and the reference strain H37Rv to compare genetic requirements for in vitro growth across these strains. We developed an analytic approach to identify quantitative differences in genetic requirements between these genetically diverse strains, which vary in genomic structure and gene content. Using this methodology, we found differences between strains in their requirements for genes involved in fundamental cellular processes, including redox homeostasis and central carbon metabolism. Among the genes with differential requirements were katG, which encodes the activator of the first-line antitubercular agent isoniazid, and glcB, which encodes malate synthase, the target of a novel small-molecule inhibitor. Differences among strains in their requirement for katG and glcB predicted differences in their response to these antimicrobial agents. Importantly, these strain-specific differences in antibiotic response could not be predicted by genetic variants identified through whole genome sequencing or by gene expression analysis. Our results provide novel insight into the basis of variation among Mtb strains and demonstrate that TnSeq is a scalable method to predict clinically important phenotypic differences among Mtb strains.","Tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb) , remains a serious global health problem, causing ~1. 5 million deaths a year world-wide. Like other bacterial pathogens, diversity among strains of Mtb contributes to differences in infection outcomes, vaccine efficacy, and response to antibiotic treatment. Currently, the important genetic differences that contribute to variation among Mtb strains remain poorly understood. In this study, we applied a functional genomics technique called TnSeq to a panel of Mtb clinical strains to investigate the genetic basis of strain diversity. We identified a number of genes that are differentially required for growth in culture among these strains. Some of these genes are involved in the response to antibiotics, including the first-line antitubercular agent isoniazid and a novel antitubercular drug currently in development. We found that the genetic differences between strains uncovered by TnSeq predicted responses to these antibiotics. Our results demonstrate the utility of TnSeq for identifying clinically relevant differences among Mtb strains.","mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb) is a phenotypically monomorphic bacterium demonstrating heterogeneity in clinically relevant characteristics , including virulence and response to antibiotics . we performed genome-wide transposon mutagenesis coupled with next-generation sequencing (TnSeq) for a panel of Mtb clinical isolates and the reference strain H37Rv to compare genetic requirements for in vitro growth across these strains.methodswe found differences in genetic requirements between these genetically diverse strains in their requirements for genes involved in fundamental cellular processes including redox homeostasis and"
"The human b2-adrenergic receptor (b2AR) , a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is expressed in bronchial smooth muscle cells. Upon activation by agonists, b2AR causes bronchodilation and relief in asthma patients. The N-terminal polymorphism of b2AR at the 16th position, Arg16Gly, has warranted a lot of attention since it is linked to variations in response to albuterol (agonist) treatment. Although the b2AR is one of the well-studied GPCRs, the N-terminus which harbors this mutation, is absent in all available experimental structures. The goal of this work was to study the molecular level differences between the N-terminal variants using structural modeling and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations reveal that the N-terminal region of the Arg variant shows greater dynamics than the Gly variant, leading to differential placement. Further, the position and dynamics of the N-terminal region, further, affects the ligand binding-site accessibility. Interestingly, long-range effects are also seen at the ligand binding site, which is marginally larger in the Gly as compared to the Arg variant resulting in the preferential docking of albuterol to the Gly variant. This study thus reveals key differences between the variants providing a molecular framework towards understanding the variable drug response in asthma patients.","The human b2-adrenergic receptor ( b2AR) is an important member of the GPCR family and a mutation at the 16th position, Arg16Gly, is commonly found in the population. This variation in asthma patients is linked to differential ( good/bad) response to the drug albuterol, an agonist of the b2AR. To date, the coordinates of the N-terminal residues harboring the 16th position mutation have not been resolved. In our study we sought to glean insights into the dynamics of the variants that could address the differential response to albuterol. We used knowledge from class A GPCRs to build the N-terminal region of b2AR variants in conjunction with the available structure of the inactive receptor. This was followed by atomistic simulations in triplicate totaling to a sampling of 6 us. We observe that the N-terminal region of the Arg variant is more dynamic than the Gly variant. Amongst the various differences between the variants, we observe long-range effects at the binding site leading to preferential docking of albuterol to the Gly variant. Our work is a first step to unravel the molecular mechanism linking the Arg16Gly variation to the differential response to albuterol in asthma patients.","the human b2-adrenergic receptor (b2AR) , a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family , is expressed in bronchial smooth muscle cells .

"Although extensive research has demonstrated host-retrovirus microevolutionary dynamics, it has been difficult to gain a deeper understanding of the macroevolutionary patterns of host-retrovirus interactions. Here we use recent technological advances to infer broad patterns in retroviral diversity, evolution, and host-virus relationships by using a large-scale phylogenomic approach using endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) . Retroviruses insert a proviral DNA copy into the host cell genome to produce new viruses. ERVs are provirus insertions in germline cells that are inherited down the host lineage and consequently present a record of past host-viral associations. By mining ERVs from 65 host genomes sampled across vertebrate diversity, we uncover a great diversity of ERVs, indicating that retroviral sequences are much more prevalent and widespread across vertebrates than previously appreciated. The majority of ERV clades that we recover do not contain known retroviruses, implying either that retroviral lineages are highly transient over evolutionary time or that a considerable number of retroviruses remain to be identified. By characterizing the distribution of ERVs, we show that no major vertebrate lineage has escaped retroviral activity and that retroviruses are extreme host generalists, having an unprecedented ability for rampant host switching among distantly related vertebrates. In addition, we examine whether the distribution of ERVs can be explained by host factors predicted to influence viral transmission and find that internal fertilization has a pronounced effect on retroviral colonization of host genomes. By capturing the mode and pattern of retroviral evolution and contrasting ERV diversity with known retroviral diversity, our study provides a cohesive framework to understand host-virus coevolution better.","Significance For millions of years retroviruses, such as HIV in humans, have attacked vertebrates. Occasionally retroviruses infiltrate germ cells, incorporate themselves into the host's genome, and transmit vertically to the host's offspring as endogenous retroviruses ( ERVs) . Consequently, ERVs make up large portions of vertebrate genomes and represent a record of past host-retrovirus interactions. We developed pan-vertebrate ERV analyses to provide an overview of host-retrovirus interactions, generating insights into retroviral evolution, diversity, host-switching, and the factors influencing retroviral transmission. Astoundingly, we found over 36, 000 ERV lineages across our sample of vertebrate diversity. The results provide knowledge about host-retrovirus coevolution, suggesting an unprecedented ability of retroviruses to switch between distantly related vertebrates and implying existence of additional, yet unidentified retroviruses.","endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are provirus insertions in germline cells that are inherited down the host lineage and consequently present a record of past host-viral associations . here we use recent technological advances to infer broad patterns in retroviral diversity, evolution, and host-virus relationships by using a large-scale phylogenomic approach using ervs . by mining ERvs from 65 host genomes sampled across vertebrate diversity, we uncover a great diversity of ERV clades that we recover do not contain known retrovirals , implying that no major vertebrat lineage has "
"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) , a neglected tropical disease (NTD) preventable through mass drug administration (MDA) , is one of six diseases deemed possibly eradicable. Previously we developed one LF elimination scenario, which assumes MDA scale-up to continue in all countries that have previously undertaken MDA. In contrast, our three previously developed eradication scenarios assume all LF endemic countries will undertake MDA at an average (eradication I) , fast (eradication II) , or instantaneous (eradication III) rate of scale-up. In this analysis we use a micro-costing model to project the financial and economic costs of each of these scenarios in order to provide evidence to decision makers about the investment required to eliminate and eradicate LF. Costing was undertaken from a health system perspective, with all results expressed in 2012 US dollars (USD) . A discount rate of 3% was applied to calculate the net present value of future costs. Prospective NTD budgets from LF endemic countries were reviewed to preliminarily determine activities and resources necessary to undertake a program to eliminate LF at a country level. In consultation with LF program experts, activities and resources were further reviewed and a refined list of activities and necessary resources, along with their associated quantities and costs, were determined and grouped into the following activities: advocacy and communication, capacity strengthening, coordination and strengthening partnerships, data management, ongoing surveillance, monitoring and supervision, drug delivery, and administration. The costs of mapping and undertaking transmission assessment surveys and the value of donated drugs and volunteer time were also accounted for. Using previously developed scenarios and deterministic estimates of MDA duration, the financial and economic costs of interrupting LF transmission under varying rates of MDA scale-up were then modelled using a micro-costing approach. The elimination scenario, which includes countries that previously undertook MDA, is estimated to cost 929 million USD (95% Credible Interval: 884m-972m) . Proceeding to eradication is anticipated to require a higher financial investment, estimated at 1. 24 billion USD (1. 17bn-1. 30bn) in the eradication III scenario (immediate scale-up) , with eradication II (intensified scale-up) projected at 1. 27 billion USD (1. 21bn-1. 33bn) , and eradication I (slow scale-up) estimated at 1. 29 billion USD (1. 23bn-1. 34bn) . The economic costs of the eradication III scenario are estimated at approximately 7. 57 billion USD (7. 12bn-7. 94bn) , while the elimination scenario is projected to have an economic cost of 5. 21 billion USD (4. 91bn-5. 45bn) . Countries in the AFRO region will require the greatest investment to reach elimination or eradication, but also stand to gain the most in cost savings. Across all scenarios, capacity strengthening and advocacy and communication represent the greatest financial costs, whereas mapping, post-MDA surveillance, and administration comprise the least. Though challenging to implement, our results indicate that financial and economic savings are greatest under the eradication III scenario. Thus, if eradication for LF is the objective, accelerated scale-up is projected to be the best investment.","Lymphatic filariasis ( LF) is a neglected tropical disease ( NTD) that is targeted for elimination and is thought to be potentially eradicable through once yearly mass drug administration ( MDA) using drugs that are currently donated to LF endemic countries by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture them. MDA has proven to be a cost-effective and efficient method of disease control, both for LF and other NTDs. Previously, we developed scale-up scenarios of varying magnitude to reach elimination ( elimination of LF in all countries that have previously undertaken MDA) and eradication ( local elimination of LF in all LF endemic countries) and estimated the number of associated treatments that would be necessary in each country under each scenario. Here we project the costs--both financial and economic--of each of these scenarios. We use data from a myriad of sources to estimate the cost of various activities, and found that training and advocacy and communication activities comprise the bulk of the costs of the program. Among all scenarios, elimination requires the least total investment. However, in terms of LF eradication, faster rates of MDA scale-up are associated with decreased overall costs.","a micro-costing model was used to project the financial and economic costs of each of these scenarios in order to provide evidence to decision makers about the investment required to eliminate and eradicate Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) . the eradication III scenario is estimated to cost 929 million USD ( 95% Credible Interval: 884m-972m) , followed by a reduction rate of 3% to calculate the net present value of future costs . a refined list of activities and necessary resources , along with their associated quantities and costs , were determined and grouped into the following activities: advocacy and communication , capacity strengthening , coordination and strengthening partnerships , data management "
"The Type III Secretion System (T3SS) is a macromolecular complex used by Gram-negative bacteria to secrete effector proteins from the cytoplasm across the bacterial envelope in a single step. For many pathogens, the T3SS is an essential virulence factor that enables the bacteria to interact with and manipulate their respective host. A characteristic structural feature of the T3SS is the needle complex (NC) . The NC resembles a syringe with a basal body spanning both bacterial membranes and a long needle-like structure that protrudes from the bacterium. Based on the paradigm of a syringe-like mechanism, it is generally assumed that effectors and translocators are unfolded and secreted from the bacterial cytoplasm through the basal body and needle channel. Despite extensive research on T3SS, this hypothesis lacks experimental evidence and the mechanism of secretion is not fully understood. In order to elucidate details of the T3SS secretion mechanism, we generated fusion proteins consisting of a T3SS substrate and a bulky protein containing a knotted motif. Because the knot cannot be unfolded, these fusions are accepted as T3SS substrates but remain inside the NC channel and obstruct the T3SS. To our knowledge, this is the first time substrate fusions have been visualized together with isolated NCs and we demonstrate that substrate proteins are secreted directly through the channel with their N-terminus first. The channel physically encloses the fusion protein and shields it from a protease and chemical modifications. Our results corroborate an elementary understanding of how the T3SS works and provide a powerful tool for in situ-structural investigations in the future. This approach might also be applicable to other protein secretion systems that require unfolding of their substrates prior to secretion.","Type III Secretion Systems ( T3SS) secrete bacterial effector proteins from the cytoplasm across the cell wall, but mechanistic details of this process remain mostly elusive. We locked the T3SS of Shigella flexneri in an actively secreting state by expression of substrate fusions that consist of a functional translocator and a stably-folded knotted protein. Although recognized as T3SS substrates, the fusions are not released from secreting Shigella and impede transport of other effector proteins by obstructing the T3SS channel. We localized the fusion at isolated channels and observed that the translocator is secreted with the N-terminus first. We further demonstrate that the channel physically encloses the partially transported substrate. Our analysis elucidates important steps of the T3SS mechanism. Furthermore, we developed fusion proteins useful for advanced structural investigations of one of the most complex bacterial virulence devices known and our approach may help to also understand other protein transport mechanisms.","the type III secretion system ( T3SS) is a macromolecular complex used by Gram-negative bacteria to secrete effector proteins from the cytoplasm across the bacterial envelope in a single step . the needle complex (NC) resembles a syringe with a basal body spanning both bacterial membranes and a long needle-like structure that protrudes from the bacteria . to our knowledge, this is the first time substrate fusions have been visualized together with isolated NCs and we demonstrate that substrate proteins are secreted directly through the channel with their N-terminus first . a knotted motif containing a"
"Buruli ulcer [BU] is a chronic and debilitating neglected tropical skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The treatment of moderate to severe BU affects the well-being of entire households and places a strain on both gender relations within households and social relations with kin asked for various types of support. In this paper, we employ the conceptual lenses provided by the Household Production of Health approach to understanding the impact of illness on the household as a unit of analysis, gender studies, and social support related research to better understand BU health care decision making and the psychosocial experience of BU hospitalization. An ethnography attentive to circumstance and the nested contexts within which stakeholders respond to BU was conducted employing semi-structured interviews, illness narratives, and case studies. An iterative process of data collection with preliminary analyses and reflection shaped subsequent interviews. Interviews were conducted with 45 women in households having a member afflicted with BU in two communes of Benin with high prevalence rates for BU. The first commune [ZE] has a well-established decentralized BU treatment program and a well-functioning referral network linked to the Allada reference hospital specializing in the care of BU and other chronic ulcers. The second commune [Ouinhi] is one of the last regions of the country to introduce a decentralized BU treatment program. A maximum variation purposeful sample was selected to identify information-rich health care decision cases for in-depth study. Study results demonstrated that although men are the primary decision makers for healthcare decisions outside the home, women are largely responsible for arranging care for the afflicted in hospital in addition to managing their own households. A woman's agency and ability to influence the decision-making process is largely based on whatever social support and substitute labor she can mobilize from her own network of kin relations. When support wanes, women are placed in a vulnerable position and often end up destitute. Decentralized BU treatment is preferred because it enables a woman to remain in her own household as a patient or caretaker of an ill family member while engaging in child care and petty revenue earing activities. Remaining in the hospital (a liminal space) as either patient or caretaker also renders a woman vulnerable to rumor and innuendo about sexual liaisons and constitutes a form of social risk. Social risk in some cases eclipses the physical risk of the disease in what we would describe as a hierarchy of risks. This study illustrates the importance of decentralized treatment programs for NTDs such as BU. Such programs enable patients to remain in their homes while being treated, and do not displace women responsible for the welfare of the entire household. When women are displaced the well-being of the entire household is placed in jeopardy.","In this gender-focused study of the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer ( BU) in Benin, West Africa, we document how seeking care for BU is influenced by broad-based concerns about the household production of health and the availability of resources women can mobilize from their social support networks. Women and girls shoulder a disproportionate share of the burdens incurred by BU treatment and prefer decentralized treatment from local health stations to free hospital care. Long term and often-indeterminate residence in hospital threatens the integrity of households and results in marital stress, economic vulnerability, school and vocational training dropout, and loss of essential income-generating activities. The case study of BU clearly demonstrates the necessity of recognizing the household, and not just the patient, as a unit of analysis in public health and the need to consider the ripple effect of serious illness beyond the household to one's social network. We draw attention to the fact that while men are the decision makers about health care in patrilineal Beninese society, a women's agency in influencing decision making is tied to her accumulation of social capital, capital that is taxed by long term medical treatment weakening her safety net in the future.","background : the treatment of moderate to severe buruli ulcer ( BU) affects the well-being of entire households and places a strain on both gender relations within households and social relations with kin asked for various types of support.objectives:this paper employs the conceptual lenses provided by the Household Production of Health approach to understanding the impact of illness on the household as a unit of analysis, gender studies, and social support related research to better understand BU health care decision making and the psychosocial experience of BU hospitalization.materials and methods : an ethnography attentive to circumstance and the nested contexts within which stakeholders respond to BU was conducted employing semi-structured interviews,"
"Competition between antigen-specific T cells for peptide: MHC complexes shapes the ensuing T cell response. Mouse model studies provided compelling evidence that competition is a highly effective mechanism controlling the activation of naive T cells. However, assessing the effect of T cell competition in the context of a human infection requires defined pathogen kinetics and trackable naive and memory T cell populations of defined specificity. A unique cohort of nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients allowed us to assess T cell competition in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, which was documented with detailed virology data. In our cohort, hematopoietic stem cell transplant donors and recipients were CMV seronegative and positive, respectively, thus providing genetically distinct memory and naive T cell populations. We used single-cell transcriptomics to track donor versus recipient-derived T cell clones over the course of 90 d. We found that donor-derived T cell clones proliferated and expanded substantially following CMV reactivation. However, for immunodominant CMV epitopes, recipient-derived memory T cells remained the overall dominant population. This dominance was maintained despite more robust clonal expansion of donor-derived T cells in response to CMV reactivation. Interestingly, the donor-derived T cells that were recruited into these immunodominant memory populations shared strikingly similar TCR properties with the recipient-derived memory T cells. This selective recruitment of identical and nearly identical clones from the naive into the immunodominant memory T cell pool suggests that competition is in place but does not interfere with rejuvenating a memory T cell population. Instead, it results in selection of convergent clones to the memory T cell pool.","Significance An existing memory T cell population specific for a single epitope is sufficient to effectively curtail responses to any new antigens if the original epitope is present in a vaccination regimen or heterologous infections. We asked if T cell competition precludes recruitment of any new, naive T cells to an existing memory T cell pool in context of cytomegalovirus-specific T cell responses in a cohort of transplant patients. Our data indicate that competition does not prevent recruitment of naive T cells into the memory T cell pool but selects for T cells with nearly or fully congruent T cell receptor specificities. We discuss the implications of rejuvenating a memory T cell pool while preserving the T cell receptor repertoire.","a unique cohort of nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients allowed us to assess T cell competition in response to cytomegalovirus reactivation , which was documented with detailed virology data . we used single-cell transcriptomics to track donor versus recipient-derived T cell clones over the course of 90 d. we found that donor-derived memory and naive memory T cells remained the overall dominant population . this dominance was maintained despite more robust clonal expansion of donor -derived tissue - convergent cells into the immunodominant memory T cell pool . in our cohort"
"Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are known to possess a relatively open chromatin structure; yet, despite efforts to characterize the chromatin signatures of ESCs, the role of chromatin compaction in stem cell fate and function remains elusive. Linker histone H1 is important for higher-order chromatin folding and is essential for mammalian embryogenesis. To investigate the role of H1 and chromatin compaction in stem cell pluripotency and differentiation, we examine the differentiation of embryonic stem cells that are depleted of multiple H1 subtypes. H1c/H1d/H1e triple null ESCs are more resistant to spontaneous differentiation in adherent monolayer culture upon removal of leukemia inhibitory factor. Similarly, the majority of the triple-H1 null embryoid bodies (EBs) lack morphological structures representing the three germ layers and retain gene expression signatures characteristic of undifferentiated ESCs. Furthermore, upon neural differentiation of EBs, triple-H1 null cell cultures are deficient in neurite outgrowth and lack efficient activation of neural markers. Finally, we discover that triple-H1 null embryos and EBs fail to fully repress the expression of the pluripotency genes in comparison with wild-type controls and that H1 depletion impairs DNA methylation and changes of histone marks at promoter regions necessary for efficiently silencing pluripotency gene Oct4 during stem cell differentiation and embryogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that H1 plays a critical role in pluripotent stem cell differentiation, and our results suggest that H1 and chromatin compaction may mediate pluripotent stem cell differentiation through epigenetic repression of the pluripotency genes.","The epigenome and chromatin play critical roles in stem cell fate determination. Linker histone H1 is a major chromatin structural protein that facilitates higher-order chromatin folding. By analyzing the differentiation capacity of embryonic stem cells ( ESCs) that lack multiple H1 subtypes, we find, for the first time, that H1 and higher-order chromatin compaction are required for proper differentiation and lineage commitment of pluripotent stem cells. Triple-H1 null murine ESCs are impaired in both spontaneous differentiation and embryoid body differentiation. Furthermore, triple-H1 null ESCs are compromised in neural differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that H1 depletion leads to failure of efficient repression of pluripotency gene expression both in embryos and in ESC differentiation. We present evidence that H1 participates in mediating changes of histone marks and DNA methylation necessary for silencing pluripotency gene Oct4 during stem cell differentiation and embryogenesis. This finding is important because it provides a mechanistic link by which H1 and chromatin compaction may participate in pluripotent stem cell differentiation through repression of pluripotency gene expression.","pluripotent embryonic stem cells ( ESCs) are known to possess a relatively open chromatin structure ; yet, despite efforts to characterize the chroin signatures of ESC , the role of chromatine compaction in stem cell fate and function remains elusive . we examine the differentiation of embryon stem cells that are depleted of multiple H1 subtypes . furthermore, the majority of the triple-H1 null embryoid bodies (EBs) lack morphological structures representing the three germ layers and retain gene expression signatures characteristic of undifferentiated ESC.in summary, we demonstrate that H1 plays a critical role in pl"
"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is arguably the world's best-understood bacterial pathogen. However, crucial details about the genetic programs used by the bacterium to survive and replicate in macrophages have remained obscure because of the challenge of studying gene expression of intracellular pathogens during infection. Here, we report the use of deep sequencing (RNA-seq) to reveal the transcriptional architecture and gene activity of Salmonella during infection of murine macrophages, providing new insights into the strategies used by the pathogen to survive in a bactericidal immune cell. We characterized 3583 transcriptional start sites that are active within macrophages, and highlight 11 of these as candidates for the delivery of heterologous antigens from Salmonella vaccine strains. A majority (88%) of the 280 S. Typhimurium sRNAs were expressed inside macrophages, and SPI13 and SPI2 were the most highly expressed pathogenicity islands. We identified 31 S. Typhimurium genes that were strongly up-regulated inside macrophages but expressed at very low levels during in vitro growth. The SalComMac online resource allows the visualisation of every transcript expressed during bacterial replication within mammalian cells. This primary transcriptome of intra-macrophage S. -Typhimurium describes the transcriptional start sites and the transcripts responsible for virulence traits, and catalogues the sRNAs that may play a role in the regulation of gene expression during infection.","The burden of Salmonellosis remains unacceptably high throughout the world and control measures have had limited success. Because Salmonella bacteria can be transmitted from the wider environment to animals and humans, the bacteria encounter diverse environments that include food, water, plant surfaces and the extracellular and intracellular phases of infection of eukaryotic hosts. An intricate transcriptional network has evolved to respond to a variety of environmental signals and control the ""right time/ right place"" expression of virulence genes. To understand how transcription is rewired during intracellular infection, we determined the primary transcriptome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium within murine macrophages. We report the coding genes, sRNAs and transcriptional start sites that are expressed within macrophages at 8 hours after infection, and use these to infer gene function. We identified gene promoters that are specifically expressed within macrophages and could drive the intracellular delivery of antigens by S. Typhimurium vaccine strains. These data contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms used by Salmonella to regulate virulence gene expression whilst replicating inside mammalian cells.","introduction : Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is arguably the world's best-understood bacterial pathogen . however, crucial details about the genetic programs used by the bacterium to survive and replicate in macrophages have remained obscure because of the challenge of studying gene expression of intracellular pathogens during infection . here, we report the use of deep sequencing (RNA-seq) to reveal the transcriptional architecture and gene activity of Salmonella during infection of murine macrophags , providing new insights into the strategies used by salmonella to survive in a bactericidal immune cell . we characterized 3583 transcriptional start"
"In hydraulic fracturing, water is injected at high pressure to crack shale formations. More sustainable techniques use aqueous foams as injection fluids to reduce the water use and wastewater treatment of conventional hydrofractures. However, the physical mechanism of foam fracturing remains poorly understood, and this lack of understanding extends to other applications of compressible foams such as fire-fighting, energy storage, and enhanced oil recovery. Here we show that the injection of foam is much different from the injection of incompressible fluids and results in striking dynamics of fracture propagation that are tied to the compressibility of the foam. An understanding of bubble-scale dynamics is used to develop a model for macroscopic, compressible flow of the foam, from which a scaling law for the fracture length as a function of time is identified and exhibits excellent agreement with our experimental results.","Significance Hydraulic fracturing plays an important role in meeting today's energy demands. However, the substantial use of fresh water in fracturing and wastewater returning to the surface pose risks to the environment. Alternative technology has been developed that reduces the water-related risks by injecting aqueous foam instead of water to fracture shale formations, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show, using laboratory experiments, that the injection of foam instead of water dramatically changes the fracture dynamics when the foam compressibility is important. We develop a scaling argument for the fracture dynamics that exhibits excellent agreement with the experimental results.

"Although kinetochores normally play a key role in sister chromatid separation and segregation, chromosome fragments lacking kinetochores (acentrics) can in some cases separate and segregate successfully. In Drosophila neuroblasts, acentric chromosomes undergo delayed, but otherwise normal sister separation, revealing the existence of kinetochore- independent mechanisms driving sister chromosome separation. Bulk cohesin removal from the acentric is not delayed, suggesting factors other than cohesin are responsible for the delay in acentric sister separation. In contrast to intact kinetochore-bearing chromosomes, we discovered that acentrics align parallel as well as perpendicular to the mitotic spindle. In addition, sister acentrics undergo unconventional patterns of separation. For example, rather than the simultaneous separation of sisters, acentrics oriented parallel to the spindle often slide past one another toward opposing poles. To identify the mechanisms driving acentric separation, we screened 117 RNAi gene knockdowns for synthetic lethality with acentric chromosome fragments. In addition to well-established DNA repair and checkpoint mutants, this candidate screen identified synthetic lethality with X-chromosome-derived acentric fragments in knockdowns of Greatwall (cell cycle kinase) , EB1 (microtubule plus-end tracking protein) , and Map205 (microtubule-stabilizing protein) . Additional image-based screening revealed that reductions in Topoisomerase II levels disrupted sister acentric separation. Intriguingly, live imaging revealed that knockdowns of EB1, Map205, and Greatwall preferentially disrupted the sliding mode of sister acentric separation. Based on our analysis of EB1 localization and knockdown phenotypes, we propose that in the absence of a kinetochore, microtubule plus-end dynamics provide the force to resolve DNA catenations required for sister separation.","Kinetochores, the site on the chromosomes to which microtubules attach driving the separation and segregation of replicated sister chromosomes, have been viewed as essential for proper cell division and accurate transmission of chromosomes into daughter cells. However previous studies demonstrated that sister chromosomes lacking kinetochores ( acentrics) often undergo separation, segregation and transmission. Here we demonstrate that sister acentrics are held together through DNA intertwining. We show that during anaphase, acentric sister separation is achieved through Topoisomerase activity, an enzyme that resolves these DNA linkages, as well as forces generated on the acentrics by the growing ends of highly dynamic microtubule polymers. We found that acentric sister chromatids display unique patterns of separation using mechanisms independent of the kinetochore. Additionally, we identified the specific microtubule-associated proteins required for the successful mitotic transmission of acentric chromosomes to daughter cells. These studies reveal unsuspected, distinct forces that likely act on all chromosomes during mitosis independent of kinetochore-microtubule attachments.","chromosome fragments lacking kinetochores (acentrics) undergo delayed, but otherwise normal sister separation , revealing the existence of kinetochore- independent mechanisms driving sister chromatid separation and segregation . to identify the mechanisms driving acentric separation, we screened 117 RNAi gene knockdowns for synthetic lethality with X-chromosom-derived -acentric fragments . in addition to well-established DNA repair and checkpoint mutants , we propose that in the absence of a microtubule plus-end dynamics provide the force to resolve DNA catenations required for sister separation.result"
"Receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are single transmembrane-spanning proteins which serve as molecular chaperones and allosteric modulators of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their signaling pathways. Although RAMPs have been previously studied in the context of their effects on Family B GPCRs, the coevolution of RAMPs with many GPCR families suggests an expanded repertoire of potential interactions. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based and cell-surface expression approaches, we comprehensively screen for RAMP interactions within the chemokine receptor family and identify robust interactions between RAMPs and nearly all chemokine receptors. Most notably, we identify robust RAMP interaction with atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) , which function to establish chemotactic gradients for directed cell migration. Specifically, RAMP3 association with atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) diminishes adrenomedullin (AM) ligand availability without changing G-protein coupling. Instead, RAMP3 is required for the rapid recycling of ACKR3 to the plasma membrane through Rab4-positive vesicles following either AM or SDF-1/CXCL12 binding, thereby enabling formation of dynamic spatiotemporal chemotactic gradients. Consequently, genetic deletion of either ACKR3 or RAMP3 in mice abolishes directed cell migration of retinal angiogenesis. Thus, RAMP association with chemokine receptor family members represents a molecular interaction to control receptor signaling and trafficking properties.","Significance G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs) exist within multi-protein complexes on the surface of cells in order to respond to a wide variety of extracellular stimuli such as neurotransmitters, migratory cues, hormones, light, and odors. In this study, we discover and characterize an expanded repertoire of GPCRs that interact with receptor-activity-modifying proteins ( RAMPs) --a class of proteins that can modulate the type and consequences of extracellular signals to GPCRs. Specifically, we find that RAMP interaction with chemokine GPCRs is essential for enabling these receptors to bind and degrade extracellular migratory cues and thereby establish gradients for directed cellular migration. In the absence of these critical proteins, the process of blood vessel sprouting within the postnatal retina is dysfunctional.","chemokine receptors are single transmembrane-spanning proteins which serve as molecular chaperones and allosteric modulators of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their signaling pathways . however , the coevolution of RAMPs with many GPCR families suggests an expanded repertoire of potential interactions . utilizing bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based and cell-surface expression approaches, we comprehensively screen for RAMP interactions within the chemokinase receptor family and identify robust interactions between adrenomedullin (AM) ligand availability , which function to establish chemotactic gradients"
"The typical human personal social network contains about 150 relationships including kin, friends, and acquaintances, organized into a set of hierarchically inclusive layers of increasing size but decreasing emotional intensity. Data from a number of different sources reveal that these inclusive layers exhibit a constant scaling ratio of ~3. While the overall size of the networks has been connected to our cognitive capacity, no mechanism explaining why the networks present a layered structure with a consistent scaling has been proposed. Here we show that the existence of a heterogeneous cost to relationships (in terms of time or cognitive investment) , together with a limitation in the total capacity an individual has to invest in them, can naturally explain the existence of layers and, when the cost function is linear, explain the scaling between them. We develop a one-parameter Bayesian model that fits the empirical data remarkably well. In addition, the model predicts the existence of a contrasting regime in the case of small communities, such that the layers have an inverted structure (increasing size with increasing emotional intensity) . We test the model with five communities and provide clear evidence of the existence of the two predicted regimes. Our model explains, based on first principles, the emergence of structure in the organization of personal networks and allows us to predict a rare phenomenon whose existence we confirm empirically.","Significance The way we organize our social relationships is key to understanding the structure of our society. We propose a quantitative theory to tackle this issue, assuming that our capacity to maintain relationships is limited and that different types of relationships require different investments. The theory accounts for well-documented empirical evidence on personal networks, such that connections are typically arranged in layers of increasing size and decreasing emotional content. More interestingly, it predicts that when the number of available relationships is small, this structure is inverted, having more close relationships than acquaintances. We provide evidence of the existence of both regimes in real communities and analyze the consequences of these findings in our understanding of social groups.","the typical human personal social network contains about 150 relationships including kin, friends, and acquaintances , organized into a set of hierarchically inclusive layers of increasing size but decreasing emotional intensity . while the overall size of the networks has been connected to our cognitive capacity , no mechanism explaining why the networks present a layered structure with a consistent scaling has been proposed . here we show that the existence of a heterogeneous cost to relationships (in terms of time or cognitive investment) , together with an limitation in the total capacity an individual has to invest in them , can naturally explain their existence and, when the cost function is linear , explain the scaling between them . we develop a"
"Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds are an important class of molecules that are commonly used for the synthesis of candidate drugs. Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-a (PIP5Ka) is a lipid kinase, similar to PI3K. However, the role of PIP5K1a in oncogenic processes and the development of inhibitors that selectively target PIP5K1a have not been reported. In the present study we report that overexpression of PIP5K1a is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer and correlates with an elevated level of the androgen receptor. Overexpression of PIP5K1a in PNT1A nonmalignant cells results in an increased AKT activity and an increased survival, as well as invasive malignant phenotype, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of PIP5K1a in aggressive PC-3 cells leads to a reduced AKT activity and an inhibition in tumor growth in xenograft mice. We further report a previously unidentified role for PIP5K1a as a druggable target for our newly developed compound ISA-2011B using a high-throughput KINOMEscan platform. ISA-2011B was discovered during our synthetic studies of C-1 indol-3-yl substituted 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydroisoquinolines via a Pictet-Spengler approach. ISA-2011B significantly inhibits growth of tumor cells in xenograft mice, and we show that this is mediated by targeting PIP5K1a-associated PI3K/AKT and the downstream survival, proliferation, and invasion pathways. Further, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PIP5K1a exerts similar effects on PC3 cells as ISA-2011B treatment, significantly inhibiting AKT activity, increasing apoptosis and reducing invasion. Thus, PIP5K1a has high potential as a drug target, and compound ISA-2011B is interesting for further development of targeted cancer therapy.","Significance Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the third leading cancer-related cause of death among men of the Western world. Treatment options at advanced stages of the disease are scarce, and better therapies are in urgent need. In our study, we show that the clinically relevant lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-a ( PIP5Ka) plays an important role in cancer cell invasion and survival by regulating the PI3K/AKT/androgen receptor pathways.

"Host-adapted strains of Salmonella enterica cause systemic infections and have the ability to persist systemically for long periods of time despite the presence of a robust immune response. Chronically infected hosts are asymptomatic and transmit disease to naive hosts via fecal shedding of bacteria, thereby serving as a critical reservoir for disease. We show that the bacterial effector protein SseI (also called SrfH) , which is translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system (T3SS) , is required for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI inhibits normal cell migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro, and such inhibition requires the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) , an important regulator of cell migration. SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. The C-terminal domain of SseI is similar to PMT/ToxA, a bacterial toxin that contains a cysteine residue (C1165) that is critical for activity. Mutation of the corresponding residue in SseI (C178A) eliminates SseI function in vitro and in vivo, but not binding to IQGAP1. In addition, infection with wild-type (WT) S. typhimurium suppressed DC migration to the spleen in vivo in an SseI-dependent manner. Correspondingly, examination of spleens from mice infected with WT S. typhimurium revealed fewer DC and CD4+ T lymphocytes compared to mice infected with DsseI S. typhimurium. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SseI inhibits normal host cell migration, which ultimately counteracts the ability of the host to clear systemic bacteria.","Bacteria belonging to the genus Salmonella are capable of causing long-term chronic systemic infections, and bacteria primarily reside within macrophages in lymphoid tissues and sporadically are shed in the feces. These persistently infected individuals serve as a significant reservoir for disease transmission. Despite the importance of Salmonella as a human pathogen, relatively little is known about the host immune response or virulence mechanisms of long-term systemic infections. Host-adapted Salmonella strains invade and manipulate host cells by releasing specialized bacterial effector proteins into the host cell. We show that one of these bacterial effector proteins, SseI ( SrfH) , is required for Salmonella to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI is able to block the migration of host immune cells and consequentially attenuate the host's ability to clear systemic bacteria. SseI accomplishes this inhibitory activity in part by associating with the host protein IQGAP1, an important regulator of cell migration. The amino acid sequence of SseI is similar to several other protein sequences of known bacterial pathogens, including PMT/ToxA, a toxin, indicating that these factors may function similarly to one another and may comprise a new family of bacterial effector proteins.","the bacterial effector protein SseI (also called SrfH) , which is translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system (T3SS) is required for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice . we show that the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) , an important regulator of cell migration , is required to regulate cell migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro and in vivo , but not binding to IQ"
"Background Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was introduced as a neurophysiological technique in 1985 when Anthony Barker and his team developed a compact machine that permitted non-invasive stimulation of the cerebral cortex (Barker 1985). Since its introduction, TMS has been used to evaluate the motor system, to study the function of several cerebral regions, and for the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric illnesses. In addition, it has been suggested that TMS might have therapeutic potential. Some controlled studies have evaluated the effects of repetitive TMS (rTMS) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Greenberg (Greenberg 1997) observed that a single session of right prefrontal cortex stimulation produced a significant decrease in compulsive urges in OCD patients lasting over eight hours. Other studies have reported transitory improvements in mood but there are no observations for changes in anxiety or obsessions. Objectives To develop a systematic review on the clinical efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation from randomised controlled trials in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Search methods An electronic search was performed including the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group trials register (last searched June, 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966-2002), EMBASE (1974-2002), PsycLIT (1980-2002), and bibliographies from reviewed articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Data collection and analysis All reviewers independently extracted the information and verified it by cross-checking. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Main results Three trials were included in the review and only two contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis. It was not possible to pool any results for a meta-analysis. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham TMS using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for all time periods analysed.

"Humans demonstrate a prototypical hemispheric functional segregation pattern, with language and praxis lateralizing to the left hemisphere and spatial attention, face recognition, and emotional prosody to the right hemisphere. In this study, we used fMRI to determine laterality for all five functions in each participant. Crucially, we recruited a sample of left-handers preselected for atypical (right) language dominance (n = 24) , which allowed us to characterize hemispheric asymmetry of the other functions and compare their functional segregation pattern with that of left-handers showing typical language dominance (n = 39) . Our results revealed that most participants with left language dominance display the prototypical pattern of functional hemispheric segregation (44%) or deviate from this pattern in only one function (35%) . Similarly, the vast majority of right language dominant participants demonstrated a completely mirrored brain organization (50%) or a reversal for all but one cognitive function (32%) . Participants deviating by more than one function from the standard segregation pattern showed poorer cognitive performance, in line with an oft-presumed biological advantage of hemispheric functional segregation.","Significance It is commonly assumed that cognitive functions are asymmetrically distributed across the brain according to a stereotypical pattern, with some dominant in the left hemisphere and others dominant in the right hemisphere. While presumed to present a biological optimum, this pattern is based predominantly on studies investigating only one function. We provide insight into human brain variability by determining hemisphere dominance for five functions within the same individuals. First, while typical organization is generally maintained, it is subject to more variation than is often assumed. Second, human brain organization can be completely mirrored. Finally, the finding of poorer cognitive performance in participants who strongly deviate from typical organization or its complete reversal agrees with its postulated selective advantage.","background : humans demonstrate a prototypical hemispheric functional segregation pattern , with language and praxis lateralizing to the left hemisphere and spatial attention, face recognition , and emotional prosody to the right.methods:in this study , we used fMRI to determine laterality for all five functions in each participant.results:we recruited a sample of left-handers preselected for atypical (right) language dominance (n = 24) , which allowed us to characterize asymmetry of the other functions and compare their functional hematology pattern with those of right language dominant participants . we showed that"
"Brain stimulation, a therapy increasingly used for neurological and psychiatric disease, traditionally is divided into invasive approaches, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) , and noninvasive approaches, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. The relationship between these approaches is unknown, therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, and the ideal stimulation site for a given technique is often ambiguous, limiting optimization of the stimulation and its application in further disorders. In this article, we identify diseases treated with both types of stimulation, list the stimulation sites thought to be most effective in each disease, and test the hypothesis that these sites are different nodes within the same brain network as defined by resting-state functional-connectivity MRI. Sites where DBS was effective were functionally connected to sites where noninvasive brain stimulation was effective across diseases including depression, Parkinson9s disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, essential tremor, addiction, pain, minimally conscious states, and Alzheimer's disease. A lack of functional connectivity identified sites where stimulation was ineffective, and the sign of the correlation related to whether excitatory or inhibitory noninvasive stimulation was found clinically effective. These results suggest that resting-state functional connectivity may be useful for translating therapy between stimulation modalities, optimizing treatment, and identifying new stimulation targets. More broadly, this work supports a network perspective toward understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disease, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeted brain network modulation.","Significance Brain stimulation is a powerful treatment for an increasing number of psychiatric and neurological diseases, but it is unclear why certain stimulation sites work or where in the brain is the best place to stimulate to treat a given patient or disease. We found that although different types of brain stimulation are applied in different locations, targets used to treat the same disease most often are nodes in the same brain network. These results suggest that brain networks might be used to understand why brain stimulation works and to improve therapy by identifying the best places to stimulate the brain.","brain stimulation is a therapy increasingly used for neurological and psychiatric disease . the relationship between these approaches is unknown , therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear , and the ideal stimulation site for a given technique is often ambiguous , limiting optimization of the stimulation and its application in further disorders . in this article , we identify diseases treated with both types of stimulation , list the stimulation sites thought to be most effective in each disease, and test the hypothesis that these sites are different nodes within the same brain network as defined by resting-state functional-connectivity MRI . a lack of functional connectivity identified sites where noninvasive brain stimulation was effective across diseases including depression, Parkinson9s disease"
"Trypanosoma vivax is one of the most common parasites responsible for animal trypanosomosis, and although this disease is widespread in Africa and Latin America, very few studies have been conducted on the parasite's biology. This is in part due to the fact that no reproducible experimental methods had been developed to maintain the different evolutive forms of this trypanosome under laboratory conditions. Appropriate protocols were developed in the 1990s for the axenic maintenance of three major animal Trypanosoma species: T. b. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax. These pioneer studies rapidly led to the successful genetic manipulation of T. b. brucei and T. congolense. Advances were made in the understanding of these parasites' biology and virulence, and new drug targets were identified. By contrast, challenging in vitro conditions have been developed for T. vivax in the past, and this per se has contributed to defer both its genetic manipulation and subsequent gene function studies. Here we report on the optimization of non-infective T. vivax epimastigote axenic cultures and on the process of parasite in vitro differentiation into metacyclic infective forms. We have also constructed the first T. vivax specific expression vector that drives constitutive expression of the luciferase reporter gene. This vector was then used to establish and optimize epimastigote transfection. We then developed highly reproducible conditions that can be used to obtain and select stably transfected mutants that continue metacyclogenesis and are infectious in immunocompetent rodents.","Trypanosoma vivax is a major parasite of domestic animals in Africa and Americas. Most studies on this parasite have focused on gathering epidemiological data in the field. Studies on its biology, metabolism and interaction with the host immune system have been hindered by a lack of suitable tools for its maintenance in vitro and its genetic engineering. The work presented herein focused on determining axenic conditions for culturing and growing insect ( epimastigote) forms of T. vivax and prompting their differentiation into metacyclic forms that are infectious for the mammalian host. In addition, we describe the development of appropriate vectors for parasite transgenesis and selection in vitro and their use in analyzing genetically modified parasite lines. Finally, we report on the construction of the first T. vivax recombinant strain that stably expresses a foreign gene that maintains its infectivity in immunocompetent mice. Our work is a significant breakthrough in the field as it should lead, in the future, to the identification of parasite genes that are relevant to its biology and fate, and to work that may shed light on the intricacies of T. vivax-host interactions.","trypanosoma vivax is one of the most common parasites responsible for animal trypanomesomosis , and although this disease is widespread in Africa and Latin America , very few studies have been conducted on the parasite's biology . this is in part due to the fact that no reproducible experimental methods had been developed to maintain the different evolutive forms of this parasite under laboratory conditions . these pioneer studies rapidly led to the successful genetic manipulation of three major animal Trypanosome species : T. b. brucei and T. congolense . we have also constructed the first luciferase reporter gene that drives constitutive expression of"
"Affinity maturation and class switching of antibodies requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) -dependent hypermutation of Ig V(D) J rearrangements and Ig S regions, respectively, in activated B cells. AID deaminates deoxycytidine bases in Ig genes, converting them into deoxyuridines. In V(D) J regions, subsequent excision of the deaminated bases by uracil-DNA glycosylase, or by mismatch repair, leads to further point mutation or gene conversion, depending on the species. In Ig S regions, nicking at the abasic sites produced by AID and uracil-DNA glycosylases results in staggered double-strand breaks, whose repair by nonhomologous end joining mediates Ig class switching. We have tested whether nonhomologous end joining also plays a role in V(D) J hypermutation using chicken DT40 cells deficient for Ku70 or the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) . Inactivation of the Ku70 or DNA-PKcs genes in DT40 cells elevated the rate of AID-induced gene conversion as much as 5-fold. Furthermore, DNA-PKcs-deficiency appeared to reduce point mutation. The data provide strong evidence that double-strand DNA ends capable of recruiting the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex are important intermediates in Ig V gene conversion.","To generate highly specific antibodies in response to an immune challenge, the antibody genes in activated B cells mutate at a very high rate over a period of several days. The enzyme that initiates antibody gene mutation is activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID) , the first protein recognized to directly edit DNA genomes in vivo. AID induces point mutation of antibody V genes in all vertebrates, as well as transfer of short sequences from nonfunctional donor V genes to functional acceptor V genes ( ""gene conversion"") in birds and some other species. Whether or not the mechanism of AID-induced V gene mutation and gene conversion involves double-strand DNA breaks is controversial and potentially important because double-strand DNA breaks are known to promote cancer-associated gene translocations. We used genetic inactivation of a double-strand break repair protein ( DNA-dependent protein kinase) in a chicken B cell line to indirectly test whether AID induces double-strand breaks in the antibody V genes. We conclude that physiological expression of AID causes the formation of double-strand DNA ends in antibody V genes, which appear to be prevented from participating in homologous recombination if they recruit DNA-dependent protein kinase.","activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID) -dependent hypermutation of Ig V(D) J rearrangements and Ig S regions, respectively , in activated B cells . we have tested whether nonhomologous end joining also plays a role in Ig class switching using chicken DT40 cells deficient for Ku70 or the DNA-dependent protein kinases catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) . the data provide strong evidence that double-strand DNA ends capable of recruiting the gene-dependent proteins kinacidine complex are important intermediates in affinity maturation and class switching of antibodies"
"The pathogenic fungus Candida albicans can undergo phenotypic switching between two heritable states: white and opaque. This phenotypic plasticity facilitates its colonization in distinct host niches. The master regulator WOR1 is exclusively expressed in opaque phase cells. Positive feedback regulation by Wor1 on the WOR1 promoter is essential for opaque formation, however the underlying mechanism of how Wor1 functions is not clear. Here, we use tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry to identify Wor1-interacting proteins. Tup1 and its associated complex proteins are found as the major factors associated with Wor1. Tup1 occupies the same regions of the WOR1 promoter as Wor1 preferentially in opaque cells. Loss of Tup1 is sufficient to induce the opaque phase, even in the absence of Wor1. This is the first such report of a bypass of Wor1 in opaque formation. These genetic analyses suggest that Tup1 is a key repressor of the opaque state, and Wor1 functions via alleviating Tup1 repression at the WOR1 promoter. Opaque cells convert to white en masse at 37degC. We show that this conversion occurs only in the presence of glycolytic carbon sources. The opaque state is stabilized when cells are cultured on non-glycolytic carbon sources, even in a MTLa/a background. We further show that temperature and carbon source affect opaque stability by altering the levels of Wor1 and Tup1 at the WOR1 promoter. We propose that Wor1 and Tup1 form the core regulatory circuit controlling the opaque transcriptional program. This model provides molecular insights on how C. albicans adapts to different host signals to undergo phenotypic switching for colonization in distinct host niches.","The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a common member of the human gut microbiota, but can also cause serious infections in immune-compromised individuals. Morphological plasticity is essential for its ability to adapt to and colonize a varied array of diverse host niches. One such morphological cell fate transition is between the pathogenic white state and the mating-competent, gut-colonizing, commensal opaque state. The opaque state is controlled by the master regulator Wor1. In this study we sought to identify how Wor1 functions to induce and maintain the opaque phase. Starting with a mass spectroscopy-based approach followed up with genetic analyses, we identified the general transcriptional repressor Tup1 as a key repressor of the opaque state and discovered Wor1's function in repressing Tup1 activity. This regulation of opaque switching through inhibition of a repressor provides insights for how cell fate is regulated in response to different host cues and further explains how C. albicans can switch between commensal and pathogenic states.","the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans can undergo phenotypic switching between two heritable states: white and opaque . this morphological plasticity facilitates its colonization in distinct host niches . positive feedback regulation by Wor1 on the WOR1 promoter is essential for opaque formation , however the underlying mechanism of how Wor1 functions is not clear . here, we use tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry to identify Wor1-interacting proteins . we show that the opaque state is stabilized when cells are cultured on non-glycolytic carbon sources , even in a MTLa/a background . our results suggest that"
"Ammonites are among the best-known fossils of the Phanerozoic, yet their habitat is poorly understood. Three common ammonite families (Baculitidae, Scaphitidae, and Sphenodiscidae) co-occur with well-preserved planktonic and benthic organisms at the type locality of the upper Maastrichtian Owl Creek Formation, offering an excellent opportunity to constrain their depth habitats through isotopic comparisons among taxa. Based on sedimentary evidence and the micro- and macrofauna at this site, we infer that the 9-m-thick sequence was deposited at a paleodepth of 70-150 m. Taxa present throughout the sequence include a diverse assemblage of ammonites, bivalves, and gastropods, abundant benthic foraminifera, and rare planktonic foraminifera. No stratigraphic trends are observed in the isotopic data of any taxon, and thus all of the data from each taxon are considered as replicates. Oxygen isotope-based temperature estimates from the baculites and scaphites overlap with those of the benthos and are distinct from those of the plankton. In contrast, sphenodiscid temperature estimates span a range that includes estimates of the planktonic foraminifera and of the warmer half of the benthic values. These results suggest baculites and scaphites lived close to the seafloor, whereas sphenodiscids sometimes inhabited the upper water column and/or lived closer to shore. In fact, the rarity and poorer preservation of the sphenodiscids relative to the baculites and scaphites suggests that the sphenodiscid shells may have only reached the Owl Creek locality by drifting seaward after death.","Significance Because ammonites are one of the most diverse, abundant, and well-preserved clades in the history of life, they are a mainstay in macroevolutionary and biodiversity studies; however, their ecologies are poorly understood, and it is unknown whether taxa lived near the sea surface or seafloor. This uncertainty undermines their use in paleoecological and paleoenvironmental reconstructions, which depend on knowledge of organisms' depth preferences. Here, we use a rare co-occurrence of exquisitely well-preserved ammonites and planktonic and benthic organisms to constrain depth preferences of three common ammonite families by comparing the oxygen and carbon isotopic signatures of these taxa. The ammonites fall into two distinct depth habitats, enhancing the utility of these families for highly refined paleoecological and paleoclimatic studies.","ammonites are among the best-known fossils of the Phanerozoic , yet their habitat is poorly understood . we infer that the 9-m-thick sequence was deposited at a paleodepth of 70-150 m . taxa present throughout the sequence include a diverse assemblage of ammonite, bivalves, and gastropods , abundant benthic foraminifera , and rare planktonic foramina . sphenodiscid temperature estimates span a range that includes estimates of the baculites and scaphites and of the warmer half of the bentic values"
"Background Men who have sex with men (MSM) experience significant inequalities in health and well-being. They are the group in the UK at the highest risk of acquiring a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Guidance relating to both HIV infection prevention, in general, and individual-level behaviour change interventions, in particular, is very limited. Objectives To conduct an evidence synthesis of the clinical effectiveness of behaviour change interventions to reduce risky sexual behaviour among MSM after a negative HIV infection test. To identify effective components within interventions in reducing HIV risk-related behaviours and develop a candidate intervention. To host expert events addressing the implementation and optimisation of a candidate intervention. Data sources All major electronic databases (British Education Index, BioMed Central, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Educational Resource Index and Abstracts, Health and Medical Complete, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, PubMed and Social Science Citation Index) were searched between January 2000 and December 2014. Review methods A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness of individual behaviour change interventions was conducted. Interventions were examined using the behaviour change technique (BCT) taxonomy, theory coding assessment, mode of delivery and proximity to HIV infection testing. Data were summarised in narrative review and, when appropriate, meta-analysis was carried out. Supplemental analyses for the development of the candidate intervention focused on post hoc realist review method, the assessment of the sequential delivery and content of intervention components, and the social and historical context of primary studies. Expert panels reviewed the candidate intervention for issues of implementation and optimisation. Results Overall, trials included in this review (n = 10) demonstrated that individual-level behaviour change interventions are effective in reducing key HIV infection risk-related behaviours. However, there was considerable clinical and methodological heterogeneity among the trials. Exploratory meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in behaviours associated with high risk of HIV transmission (risk ratio 0. 75, 95% confidence interval 0. 62 to 0. 91) . Additional stratified analyses suggested that effectiveness may be enhanced through face-to-face contact immediately after testing, and that theory-based content and BCTs drawn from 'goals and planning' and 'identity' groups are important. All evidence collated in the review was synthesised to develop a candidate intervention. Experts highlighted overall acceptability of the intervention and outlined key ways that the candidate intervention could be optimised to enhance UK implementation. Limitations There was a limited number of primary studies. All were from outside the UK and were subject to considerable clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity. The findings of the meta-analysis must therefore be treated with caution. The lack of detailed intervention manuals limited the assessment of intervention content, delivery and fidelity. Conclusions Evidence regarding the effectiveness of behaviour change interventions suggests that they are effective in changing behaviour associated with HIV transmission. Exploratory stratified meta-analyses suggested that interventions should be delivered face to face and immediately after testing. There are uncertainties around the generalisability of these findings to the UK setting. However, UK experts found the intervention acceptable and provided ways of optimising the candidate intervention. Future work There is a need for well-designed, UK-based trials of individual behaviour change interventions that clearly articulate intervention content and demonstrate intervention fidelity.","The problemThere is a lack of guidance regarding human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection prevention in the UK. When guidance does exist, it is quite general. It does not provide detail about particular interventions that can change risky sexual behaviour among men who have sex with men ( MSM) . How we addressed the problemWe looked at published scientific studies that described interventions for MSM and were designed to change sexual risk-related behaviour ( e. g. increase condom use) after receiving a negative result from a HIV infection test. We wanted to know if these behaviour change interventions actually worked. We also wanted to know how they worked and why. What we foundWe found that these interventions improved sexual risk-related behaviour. It was more difficult to understand how and why they worked, but it was possible to set out the key components of these interventions. These key components included delivering interventions face to face immediately after HIV infection testing, supporting men in thinking through the consequences of their behaviour and identifying their future sexual health goals and encouraging them to identify solutions to the problems they perceive in realising these goals. Is it possible to implement such an intervention in the UK? We consulted experts who work in sexual health in the UK. Overall, they thought that the intervention we developed was acceptable and that it could help them. Although the findings of the report are very useful, they are based on rather old studies that were conducted outside the UK. We believe that UK research is needed to make sure that behaviour change interventions are as effective and relevant as they can be.","background Men who have sex with men (MSM) experience significant inequalities in health and well-being . they are the group in the UK at the highest risk of acquiring a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection .

"Desmosomes and adherens junctions are intercellular adhesive structures essential for the development and integrity of vertebrate tissue, including the epidermis and heart. Their cell adhesion molecules are cadherins: type 1 cadherins in adherens junctions and desmosomal cadherins in desmosomes. A fundamental difference is that desmosomes have a highly ordered structure in their extracellular region and exhibit calcium-independent hyperadhesion, whereas adherens junctions appear to lack such ordered arrays, and their adhesion is always calcium-dependent. We present here the structure of the entire ectodomain of desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) , using a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, and solution-based biophysical techniques. This structure reveals that the ectodomain of Dsg2 is flexible even in the calcium-bound state and, on average, is shorter than the type 1 cadherin crystal structures. The Dsg2 structure has an excellent fit with the electron tomography reconstructions of human desmosomes. This fit suggests an arrangement in which desmosomal cadherins form trans interactions but are too far apart to interact in cis, in agreement with previously reported observations. Cadherin flexibility may be key to explaining the plasticity of desmosomes that maintain tissue integrity in their hyperadhesive form, but can adopt a weaker, calcium-dependent adhesion during wound healing and early development.","Significance We present here an entirely novel concept in the field of cell-cell adhesion, whereby the flexibility of the extracellular domains of cadherin molecules determines the characteristics and behavior of intercellular junctions. The structure of the ectodomain of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 2 shows it is flexible in its calcium-bound form. This flexibility of the desmosomal cadherin ectodomains may be key in facilitating a unique property of desmosomes: the ability to switch from strong calcium-independent hyperadhesion in adult tissues to weaker calcium-dependent adhesion in wounds.","desmosomes and adherens junctions are intercellular adhesive structures essential for the development and integrity of vertebrate tissue , including the epidermis and heart . their cell adhesion molecules are cadherins and desmosomal cdsg2 ( desmoglein 2 ) , which exhibit calcium-independent hyperadhesion . a fundamental difference is that lesmosomas have a highly ordered structure in their extracellular region and exhibit calcium - independent cis . the ectodomain of Dsg2, using a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy"
"The Drosophila circadian oscillator controls daily rhythms in physiology, metabolism and behavior via transcriptional feedback loops. CLOCK-CYCLE (CLK-CYC) heterodimers initiate feedback loop function by binding E-box elements to activate per and tim transcription. PER-TIM heterodimers then accumulate, bind CLK-CYC to inhibit transcription, and are ultimately degraded to enable the next round of transcription. The timing of transcriptional events in this feedback loop coincide with, and are controlled by, rhythms in CLK-CYC binding to E-boxes. PER rhythmically binds CLK-CYC to initiate transcriptional repression, and subsequently promotes the removal of CLK-CYC from E-boxes. However, little is known about the mechanism by which CLK-CYC is removed from DNA. Previous studies demonstrated that the transcription repressor CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO) contributes to core feedback loop function by repressing per and tim transcription in cultured S2 cells and in flies. Here we show that CWO rhythmically binds E-boxes upstream of core clock genes in a reciprocal manner to CLK, thereby promoting PER-dependent removal of CLK-CYC from E-boxes, and maintaining repression until PER is degraded and CLK-CYC displaces CWO from E-boxes to initiate transcription. These results suggest a model in which CWO co-represses CLK-CYC transcriptional activity in conjunction with PER by competing for E-box binding once CLK-CYC-PER complexes have formed. Given that CWO orthologs DEC1 and DEC2 also target E-boxes bound by CLOCK-BMAL1, a similar mechanism may operate in the mammalian clock.","Circadian clocks control daily rhythms in animal, plant and fungal physiology, metabolism and behavior via transcriptional feedback loops. In Drosophila, the CLOCK-CYCLE ( CLK-CYC) activator complex binds E-box regulatory sequences to initiate transcription of hundreds of effector genes including their own repressors, PERIOD ( PER) and TIMELESS ( TIM) , which feed back to repress CLK-CYC until they are degraded, thus allowing another cycle of CLK-CYC activation. Although the repression process is critical for the stability and accuracy of circadian timekeeping, how PER-TIM complexes maintain a transcriptionally repressed state for many hours is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor CLOCKWORK ORANGE ( CWO) antagonizes CLK-CYC E-box binding, thus enhancing the removal of CLK-CYC from E-boxes to maintain transcriptional repression. This process requires PER, which suggests that PER-TIM and CWO cooperate to maintain a transcriptionally repressed state by removing CLK-CYC from E-boxes. These results demonstrate that PER-TIM requires CWO to effectively repress circadian transcription, and given that circadian transcriptional regulators are well conserved, this mechanism may function to repress transcription in other animals including humans.","the transcription repressor CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO) contributes to core feedback loop function by promoting repression until PER is degraded and CLK-CYC displaces CWO from E-boxes to initiate transcription . here we show that CWO rhythmically binds C-box elements upstream of core clock genes in a reciprocal manner to CLK , thereby promoting the removal of PER from a core clock gene . a similar mechanism may operate in the mammalian clock . this model suggests a model in which CWO co-represses PER-dependent removal of CLK from E"
"Icosahedral viruses are under a micrometer in diameter, their infectious genome encapsulated by a shell assembled by a multiscale process, starting from an integer multiple of 60 viral capsid or coat protein (VP) monomers. We predict and validate inter-atomic hotspot interactions between VP monomers that are important for the assembly of 3 types of icosahedral viral capsids: Adeno Associated Virus serotype 2 (AAV2) and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) , both T = 1 single stranded DNA viruses, and Bromo Mosaic Virus (BMV) , a T = 3 single stranded RNA virus. Experimental validation is by in-vitro, site-directed mutagenesis data found in literature. We combine ab-initio predictions at two scales: at the interface-scale, we predict the importance (cruciality) of an interaction for successful subassembly across each interface between symmetry-related VP monomers; and at the capsid-scale, we predict the cruciality of an interface for successful capsid assembly. At the interface-scale, we measure cruciality by changes in the capsid free-energy landscape partition function when an interaction is removed. The partition function computation uses atlases of interface subassembly landscapes, rapidly generated by a novel geometric method and curated opensource software EASAL (efficient atlasing and search of assembly landscapes) . At the capsid-scale, cruciality of an interface for successful assembly of the capsid is based on combinatorial entropy. Our study goes all the way from resource-light, multiscale computational predictions of crucial hotspot inter-atomic interactions to validation using data on site-directed mutagenesis' effect on capsid assembly. By reliably and rapidly narrowing down target interactions, (no more than 1. 5 hours per interface on a laptop with Intel Core i5-2500K @ 3. 2 Ghz CPU and 8GB of RAM) our predictions can inform and reduce time-consuming in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, or more computationally intensive in-silico analyses.","Viruses, found in all classes of living orgaisms, can be beneficial as well as harmful to their hosts. Understanding their mechanism of assembly is critical to understanding how we can inhibit or enhance their life cycle process. Icosahedral viral capsids, as elucidated by Caspar and Klug, are self-assembled from nearly identical viral capsid or coat-protein ( VP) monomers spontaneously and rapidly, with high efficacy and accuracy, a process sometimes facilitated by other biomolecules. Understanding virus assembly requires identifying crucial VP-VP hotspot interactions whose removal would disrupt the process. We combine a novel geometric method for rapidly atlasing free energy landscapes with a symmetry-based combinatorial method to give a two-scale prediction of hotspot interactions. We validate the predictions for 3 types of viruses, using in-vitro, site-directed mutagenesis' disruptive effects on capsid assembly, found in literature, noting that the biophysical assays for AAV2 were carried out by the Mavis Agbandje-Mckenna's lab contemporaneously with the development of our computational model and prediction. Our predictions are reproducible using our curated opensource software EASAL ( efficient atlasing and search of assembly landscapes) . To the best of our knowledge, prevailing methods for statistical mechanical prediction of hotspot interactions use a single scale, are knowledge-based, are computationally intensive, or have not been validated by in-vitro site directed mutagenesis results.","we predict and validate inter-atomic hotspot interactions between VP monomers that are important for the assembly of 3 types of icosahedral viral capsids : adeno Associated Virus serotype 2 (AAV2) and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) , both T = 1 single stranded DNA viruses , and Bromo Mosaic Virus (BMV) . we combine ab-initio predictions at two scales: at the interface-scale , we predict the importance (cruciality) of an interaction for successful subassembly across each interface between symmetry-related vs."
"The existence of life in extreme conditions, in particular in extraterrestrial environments, is certainly one of the most intriguing scientific questions of our time. In this report, we demonstrate the use of an innovative nanoscale motion sensor in life-searching experiments in Earth-bound and interplanetary missions. This technique exploits the sensitivity of nanomechanical oscillators to transduce the small fluctuations that characterize living systems. The intensity of such movements is an indication of the viability of living specimens and conveys information related to their metabolic activity. Here, we show that the nanomotion detector can assess the viability of a vast range of biological specimens and that it could be the perfect complement to conventional chemical life-detection assays. Indeed, by combining chemical and dynamical measurements, we could achieve an unprecedented depth in the characterization of life in extreme and extraterrestrial environments.","Significance The quest to find life in extreme and extraterrestrial environments is exciting and touches many research fields. One of the common signatures of life is movement: Even small microorganisms vibrate in response to their metabolic activity. Thus, we have devised a nanomotion detector to study these fluctuations and to associate them to the metabolic activity of the specimens. This technique does not measure the chemical response of life, which would require prior knowledge of the metabolic pathways involved. Instead, it monitors the physical manifestation of any kind of metabolic activity the microorganisms might have. Here, we show how this nanomotion detector can study any living system, paving the way to a complementary approach to the study of life in extreme environments.","the existence of life in extreme conditions, in particular in extraterrestrial environments , is certainly one of the most intriguing scientific questions of our time . in this report , we demonstrate the use of an innovative nanoscale motion sensor in life-searching experiments in Earth-bound and interplanetary missions . this technique exploits the sensitivity of nanomechanical oscillators to transduce the small fluctuations that characterize living systems . the intensity of such movements is an indication of the viability of living specimens and conveys information related to their metabolic activity . here, we show that the nanomotion detector can assess a vast range of biological specimens . by combining chemical and dynamical measurements, we could"
"In mammals, females are born with finite numbers of oocytes stockpiled as primordial follicles. Oocytes are ""reawakened"" via an ovarian-intrinsic process that initiates their growth. The forkhead transcription factor Foxo3 controls reawakening downstream of PI3K-AKT signaling. However, the identity of the presumptive upstream cell surface receptor controlling the PI3K-AKT-Foxo3 axis has been questioned. Here we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit controls reawakening. Oocyte-specific expression of a novel constitutively-active KitD818V allele resulted in female sterility and ovarian failure due to global oocyte reawakening. To confirm this result, we engineered a novel loss-of-function allele, KitL. Kit inactivation within oocytes also led to premature ovarian failure, albeit via a contrasting phenotype. Despite normal initial complements of primordial follicles, oocytes remained dormant with arrested oocyte maturation. Foxo3 protein localization in the nucleus versus cytoplasm explained both mutant phenotypes. These genetic studies provide formal genetic proof that Kit controls oocyte reawakening, focusing future investigations into the causes of primary ovarian insufficiency and ovarian aging.","In mammals, oocyte reawakening controls female fertility, the onset of the menopause, and thus, overall aging. We demonstrate here through complementary genetic experiments that Kit is the upstream receptor regulating oocyte reawakening. Although other cell surface receptors have been proposed as candidates, the data have remained contradictory, and definitive genetic evidence in support of any one receptor has been lacking. We engineered two novel Kit alleles in mice, one an activating ( gain-of-function) mutation, the other an inactivating ( loss-of-function) mutation. These alleles permitted us to conduct elegant genetic experiments whereby Kit was activated or inactivated in the oocytes of newborn mice. The results were complementary and striking. Oocyte-specific Kit activation resulted in female sterility due to reawakening of all oocytes, leading to premature ovarian failure. In contrast, Kit inactivation also led to female sterility and ovarian failure, but through a contrasting and opposite phenotype: a complete failure of primordial follicle reawakening. Additional studies demonstrated that Foxo3, a known regulator of reawakening, was the mediator of both phenotypes, linking our findings to prior discoveries. These complementary genetic experiments thus definitively incriminate Kit as the upstream receptor regulating reawakening.","in mammals, females are born with finite numbers of oocytes stockpiled as primordial follicles . the forkhead transcription factor Foxo3 controls reawakening downstream of PI3K-AKT signaling . however, the identity of the presumptive upstream cell surface receptor controlling the pct-foxo3 axis has been questioned . to confirm this result, we engineered a novel loss-of-function allele, KitL , albeit via a contrasting phenotype . here we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit controls rewaken"
"What is the best way to teach evolution? As microevolution may be configured as a branch of genetics, it being a short conceptual leap from understanding the concepts of mutation and alleles (i. e. , genetics) to allele frequency change (i. e. , evolution) , we hypothesised that learning genetics prior to evolution might improve student understanding of evolution. In the UK, genetics and evolution are typically taught to 14- to 16-y-old secondary school students as separate topics with few links, in no particular order and sometimes with a large time span between. Here, then, we report the results of a large trial into teaching order of evolution and genetics. We modified extant questionnaires to ascertain students' understanding of evolution and genetics along with acceptance of evolution. Students were assessed prior to teaching, immediately post teaching and again after several months. Teachers were not instructed what to teach, just to teach in a given order. Regardless of order, teaching increased understanding and acceptance, with robust signs of longer-term retention. Importantly, teaching genetics before teaching evolution has a significant (p < 0. 001) impact on improving evolution understanding by 7% in questionnaire scores beyond the increase seen for those taught in the inverse order. For lower ability students, an improvement in evolution understanding was seen only if genetics was taught first. Teaching genetics first additionally had positive effects on genetics understanding, by increasing knowledge. These results suggest a simple, minimally disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve evolution understanding: teach genetics first. This same alteration does not, however, result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution, which reflects a weak correlation between knowledge and acceptance of evolution. Qualitative focus group data highlights the role of authority figures in determination of acceptance.","What is the best way to teach evolution?

We found that the students being taught genetics first had a 5%-10% improvement in their understanding of evolution, above that shown in the group taught evolution first. The change was seen in both higher- and foundation-ability classes. Indeed, in the foundation classes the genetics-first approach was the only approach that enabled an increase in evolution understanding. Teaching genetics first comes at no cost to genetics understanding ( and may even improve it) .

"DNA-coated colloids can self-assemble into an incredible diversity of crystal structures, but their applications have been limited by poor understanding and control over the crystallization dynamics. To address this challenge, we use microfluidics to quantify the kinetics of DNA-programmed self-assembly along the entire crystallization pathway, from thermally activated nucleation through reaction-limited and diffusion-limited phases of crystal growth. Our detailed measurements of the temperature and concentration dependence of the kinetics at all stages of crystallization provide a stringent test of classical theories of nucleation and growth. After accounting for the finite rolling and sliding rates of micrometer-sized DNA-coated colloids, we show that modified versions of these classical theories predict the absolute nucleation and growth rates with quantitative accuracy. We conclude by applying our model to design and demonstrate protocols for assembling large single crystals with pronounced structural coloration, an essential step in creating next-generation optical metamaterials from colloids.","Significance Assembling optical metamaterials from DNA-coated colloids has been a central goal of programmable self-assembly for decades. Despite significant advances in expanding the structural diversity of colloidal crystals, a lack of understanding of the crystallization pathways has hindered the realization of programmable metamaterials. In this paper, we combine experiments and theory to develop a complete understanding of the crystallization dynamics. We show that the nucleation and growth kinetics of DNA-coated colloids are fundamentally different from those of atoms or small molecules, owing to an effective friction that arises from transient DNA hybridization. By incorporating this effective friction into classical theories, we predict the absolute rates of nucleation and growth with quantitative accuracy, enabling the design of protocols for making photonic crystals.","DNA-coated colloids can self-assemble into an incredible diversity of crystal structures , but their applications have been limited by poor understanding and control over the crystallization dynamics . to address this challenge, we use microfluidics to quantify the kinetics of DNA-programmed self-assembly along the entire crystallisation pathway , from thermally activated nucleation through reaction-limited and diffusion-limited phases of crystal growth . we show that modified versions of these classical theories predict the absolute nucleations and growth rates with quantitative accuracy . after accounting for the finite rolling and sliding rates of micrometer-sized DNA-sized colloids , we demonstrate that modified"
"Treatment with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has proven effective against HIV-1 infections in humanized mice, non-human primates, and humans. Due to the high mutation rate of HIV-1, resistance testing of the patient's viral strains to the bNAbs is still inevitable. So far, bNAb resistance can only be tested in expensive and time-consuming neutralization experiments. Here, we introduce well-performing computational models that predict the neutralization response of HIV-1 to bNAbs given only the envelope sequence of the virus. Using non-linear support vector machines based on a string kernel, the models learnt even the important binding sites of bNAbs with more complex epitopes, i. e. , the CD4 binding site targeting bNAbs, proving thereby the biological relevance of the models. To increase the interpretability of the models, we additionally provide a new kind of motif logo for each query sequence, visualizing those residues of the test sequence that influenced the prediction outcome the most. Moreover, we predicted the neutralization sensitivity of around 34, 000 HIV-1 samples from different time points to a broad range of bNAbs, enabling the first analysis of HIV resistance to bNAbs on a global scale. The analysis showed for many of the bNAbs a trend towards antibody resistance over time, which had previously only been discovered for a small non-representative subset of the global HIV-1 population.","Several sequence-based approaches exist to predict the epitope of broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bNAbs) against HIV based on the correlation between variation in the viral sequence and neutralization response to the antibody. Though the potential epitope sites can be used to predict the neutralization response, the methods are not optimized for the task, using additional structural information, additional preselection steps to identify the epitope sites, and assuming independence and/or only linear relationship between the potential sites and the neutralization response. To model also the neutralization response to bNAbs with more complex binding sites, including for example several non-consecutive residues or accompanying conformational changes, we used non-linear, multivariate machine learning techniques. Though we used only the viral sequence information, the models learnt the corresponding binding sites of the bNAbs. In general only few residues were learnt to be responsible for a change in neutralization response, which can additionally reduce the sequencing cost for application in clinical routine. We propose our tailored models to aid the patient selection process for current clinical trials for bNAb immunotherapy, but also as a basis to predict the best combinations of bNAbs, which will be required for routine clinical practice in the future.","background : treatment with broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bNAbs) has proven effective against HIV-1 infections in humanized mice, non-human primates, and humans . due to the high mutation rate of HIV-1, resistance testing of the patient's viral strains to the bnabs is still inevitable . here , we introduce well-performing computational models that predict the neutralization response of the virus given only the envelope sequence of the viral strain . utilizing non-linear support vector machines based on a string kernel, the models learnt even the important binding sites of bannabs with more complex epitopes , i. e.,"
"Organic electrosynthesis can transform the chemical industry by introducing electricity-driven processes that are more energy efficient and that can be easily integrated with renewable energy sources. However, their deployment is severely hindered by the difficulties of controlling selectivity and achieving a large energy conversion efficiency at high current density due to the low solubility of organic reactants in practical electrolytes. This control can be improved by carefully balancing the mass transport processes and electrocatalytic reaction rates at the electrode diffusion layer through pulsed electrochemical methods. In this study, we explore these methods in the context of the electrosynthesis of adiponitrile (ADN) , the largest organic electrochemical process in industry. Systematically exploring voltage pulses in the timescale between 5 and 150 ms led to a 20% increase in production of ADN and a 250% increase in relative selectivity with respect to the state-of-the-art constant voltage process. Moreover, combining this systematic experimental investigation with artificial intelligence (AI) tools allowed us to rapidly discover drastically improved electrosynthetic conditions, reaching improvements of 30 and 325% in ADN production rates and selectivity, respectively. This powerful AI-enhanced experimental approach represents a paradigm shift in the design of electrified chemical transformations, which can accelerate the deployment of more sustainable electrochemical manufacturing processes.","Significance The electrification of chemical manufacturing can enable the integration of renewable electricity sources into a sustainable chemical industry.

"Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis is a parasitic infection occurring in many developing countries. Data on the status of human infections in Zambia is largely lacking. We conducted a community-based study in Eastern Zambia to determine the prevalence of human taeniosis and cysticercosis in a rural community. Stool and serum samples were collected from willing participants. Geographical references of the participants' households were determined and household questionnaires administered. Taeniosis was diagnosed in stool samples by coprology and by the polyclonal antibody-based copro-antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (copro-Ag ELISA) , while cysticercosis was diagnosed in serum by the B158/B60 monoclonal antibody-based antigen ELISA (sero-Ag ELISA) . Identification of the collected tapeworm after niclosamide treatment and purgation was done using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) . A total of 255 households from 20 villages participated in the study, 718 stool and 708 serum samples were collected and examined. Forty-five faecal samples (6. 3%) were found positive for taeniosis on copro-Ag ELISA while circulating cysticercus antigen was detected in 5. 8% (41/708) individuals. The tapeworm recovered from one of the cases was confirmed to be T. solium on PCR-RFLP. Seropositivity (cysticercosis) was significantly positively related to age (p = 0. 00) and to copro-Ag positivity (taeniosis) (p = 0. 03) but not to gender. Change point analysis revealed that the frequency of cysticercus antigens increased significantly in individuals above the age of 30. Copro-Ag positivity was not related to age or gender. The following risk factors were noted to be present in the study community: free-range pig husbandry system and poor sanitation with 47. 8% of the households visited lacking latrines. This study has recorded high taeniosis and cysticercosis prevalences and identified the need for further studies on transmission dynamics and impact of the disease on the local people.","Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis is a zoonotic infection endemic in many developing countries, with humans as the definitive host ( taeniosis) and pigs and humans as the intermediate hosts ( cysticercosis) .

In Africa, most studies have been carried out in pigs with little or no data in humans available. In this human study, conducted in a rural community in Eastern Zambia, prevalences for taeniosis and cysticercosis were determined at 6. 3% and 5. 8% respectively, indicating the hyperendemicity of the area. Cysticercosis infection was strongly related with age, with a significant increase in prevalence occurring in individuals from the age of 30 onward. A collected tapeworm was confirmed to be T. solium. Risk factors associated with the transmission and maintenance of the parasite such as free roaming pigs, households without latrines, backyard slaughter of pigs without inspection and consumption of undercooked pork were also present.

"Gallium is a semi-metallic element known since the 1930s to have antimicrobial activity. This activity stems primarily from gallium's ability to mimic trivalent iron and disrupt specific Fe(III) -dependent pathways, particularly DNA synthesis (due to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase) . Because of its novel mechanism of action, gallium is currently being investigated as a new antibacterial agent, particularly in light of the increasing resistance of many pathogenic bacteria to existing antibiotics. Gallium maltolate (GaM) is being developed as an orally and topically administrable form of gallium. Yaws is a neglected tropical disease affecting mainly the skin and skeletal system of children in underprivileged settings. It is currently the object of a WHO-promoted eradication campaign using mass administration of the macrolide azithromycin, an antibiotic to which the yaws agent Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue has slowly begun to develop genetic resistance. Because yaws transmission is mainly due to direct skin contact with an infectious skin lesion, we evaluated the treponemicidal activity of GaM applied topically to skin lesions in a rabbit model of yaws. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by measuring lesion diameter, treponemal burden in lesion aspirates as determined by dark field microscopy and amplification of treponemal RNA, serology, and immunohistochemistry of biopsied tissue samples. Our results show that topical GaM was effective in reducing treponemal burden in yaws experimental lesions, particularly when applied at the first sign of lesion appearance but, as expected, did not prevent pathogen dissemination. Early administration of GaM to yaws lesions could reduce the infectivity of the lesions and thus yaws transmission, potentially contributing to current and future yaws control campaigns.","Yaws is a neglected tropical disease affecting children in underprivileged countries, transmitted through direct skin contact with an active lesion.

Because this phenomenon has the potential to undermine the eradication effort, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of gallium maltolate, which has a novel mechanism of action, against the yaws pathogen. Our initial results show that topical application of gallium maltolate has significant treponemicidal activity, and suggest that this compound might find an application in the effort to eradicate yaws.

"Background Acute bronchiolitis is a common respiratory infection and a major cause of morbidity in young children. It is treated with bronchodilators (for example, salbutamol), corticosteroids or humidified air (steam inhalation or cool mist). Steam inhalation is preferred in low-income countries as it is inexpensive and easily available. It is thought to act as a secretolytic agent to lighten secretions in the respiratory tract and relieve respiratory distress. Objectives To evaluate the effect of steam inhalation or humidified oxygen to relieve respiratory distress and to evaluate adverse events in children up to three years old with acute bronchiolitis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 1) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1950 to February Week 4, 2010), EMBASE.com (1974 to March 2010), CINAHL (1981 to March 2010), AMED (1985 to March 2010), Web of Science (2000 to March 2010) and LILACS (1982 to March 2010). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials involving children up to three years old with bronchiolitis comparing steam inhalation (or cool mist) or humidified oxygen against bronchodilators, corticosteroids or placebo; alone or in combination. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results Only one study (156 children aged between seven weeks and 24 months with signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Participants were randomised into three groups: nebulised salbutamol, nebulised saline and mist in a tent. The results showed a significant decrease in respiratory distress symptom (RDS) score in the nebulised salbutamol group but no significant decrease in the RDS score in the mist in a tent or nebulised saline groups. The study did not report on adverse effects of the interventions. Authors' conclusions Steam inhalation (or cool mist therapy) is commonly used to treat acute bronchiolitis in resource-constrained settings. One study was eligible for inclusion and found that nebulised salbutamol was an effective intervention for young children with bronchiolitis but mist in a tent did not lead to a significant decrease in RDS score. Since only one study was analysed it would be misleading to conclude that mist therapy is ineffective in children with bronchiolitis. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to inform practice regarding using steam inhalation or mist therapy for acute bronchiolitis in children up to three years old.","Steam inhalation or humidified oxygen for acute bronchiolitis in children under three years of age Bronchiolitis is the commonest respiratory infection in young children up to three years of age. It is commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus. Children with bronchiolitis have a cough, fast and difficult breathing, nasal congestion, fever and wheeze. The disease is treated using drugs (bronchodilators and corticosteroids) and humidified air. Humidified air as steam inhalation or mist is thought to help the patient by lightening respiratory tract secretions and relieving the symptoms of respiratory distress. We searched and reviewed studies that used humidified air alone or in combination with drugs to relieve the symptoms of the infection in children less than three years of age. We found only one study (156 children) that met our criteria for analysis. The study compared nebulised salbutamol and mist in a tent (humidified air). The results showed that nebulised salbutamol was effective in relieving respiratory distress in acute bronchiolitis in young children while mist therapy was not effective. The study did not report on adverse effects for either intervention. Although the study was of high quality, some issues regarding patient allocation to the various treatment groups were not very satisfactory. There is currently not enough evidence to state that steam inhalation or mist is useful in young children with bronchiolitis. More well-designed trials of the effectiveness of humidified oxygen, mist therapy or steam inhalation compared with other treatments for acute bronchiolitis are needed.","background Acute bronchiolitis is a common respiratory infection and a major cause of morbidity in young children . steam inhalation is preferred in low-income countries as it is inexpensive and easily available . it is thought to act as a secretolytic agent to lighten secretions in the respiratory tract and relieve respiratory distress and to evaluate adverse events in children up to three years old with acute broncholitis.methodswe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1950 to February Week 4, 2010) , EMBASE.com (19"
"The ability to respond to environmental temperature variation is essential for survival in animals. Flies show robust temperature-preference behaviour (TPB) to find optimal temperatures. Recently, we have shown that Drosophila mushroom body (MB) functions as a center controlling TPB. However, neuromodulators that control the TPB in MB remain unknown. To identify the functions of dopamine in TPB, we have conducted various genetic studies in Drosophila. Inhibition of dopamine biosynthesis by genetic mutations or treatment with chemical inhibitors caused flies to prefer temperatures colder than normal. We also found that dopaminergic neurons are involved in TPB regulation, as the targeted inactivation of dopaminergic neurons by expression of a potassium channel (Kir2. 1) induced flies with the loss of cold avoidance. Consistently, the mutant flies for dopamine receptor gene (DopR) also showed a cold temperature preference, which was rescued by MB-specific expression of DopR. Based on these results, we concluded that dopamine in MB is a key component in the homeostatic temperature control of Drosophila. The current findings will provide important bases to understand the logic of thermosensation and temperature preference decision in Drosophila.","Temperature affects almost all aspects of animal development and physiological processes. The dependence of the body temperature of small insects on ambient temperature and other heat sources makes it plausible that neuronal mechanisms for sensing temperature and behavioral responses for maintaining body temperature in a permissive range must exist. By using the fruit fly model system and previously settled paradigms of temperature-preference test, we find that dopamine regulates temperature-preference behaviours. Wild-type flies show a strong temperature preference for 25degC, but inhibition of dopamine biosynthesis by genetic mutations or treatment with chemical inhibitors causes animals to prefer temperatures colder than normal. We also show that dopaminergic neurons are involved in the regulation of temperature-preference behaviours and that dopamine signalling in mushroom body neurons plays a critical role in regulating the behaviours. These results suggest that dopamine is a key component in the homeostatic temperature control of fruit flies.","flies show robust temperature-preference behaviour (TPB) to find optimal temperatures . to identify the functions of dopamine in Drosophila mushroom body ( MB) , we have conducted various genetic studies in MB . we also found that doppaminergic neurons are involved in the TPB regulation , as the targeted inactivation of a potassium channel (Kir2 1) induced fly to prefer temperatures colder than normal . based on these results, the mutant flie for dopr showed a cold temperature preference, which was rescued by MB-specific expression of DopR . in addition , a mutant mutant mutant "
"Scabies is a disease of worldwide significance, causing considerable morbidity in both humans and other animals. The scabies mite Sarcoptes scabiei burrows into the skin of its host, obtaining nutrition from host skin and blood. Aspartic proteases mediate a range of diverse and essential physiological functions such as tissue invasion and migration, digestion, moulting and reproduction in a number of parasitic organisms. We investigated whether aspartic proteases may play role in scabies mite digestive processes. We demonstrated the presence of aspartic protease activity in whole scabies mite extract. We then identified a scabies mite aspartic protease gene sequence and produced recombinant active enzyme. The recombinant scabies mite aspartic protease was capable of digesting human haemoglobin, serum albumin, fibrinogen and fibronectin, but not collagen III or laminin. This is consistent with the location of the scabies mites in the upper epidermis of human skin. The development of novel therapeutics for scabies is of increasing importance given the evidence of emerging resistance to current treatments. We have shown that a scabies mite aspartic protease plays a role in the digestion of host skin and serum molecules, raising the possibility that interference with the function of the enzyme may impact on mite survival.","Scabies is an infectious disease of the skin caused by infestation with the parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei.

This raises the possibility that interfering with the function of this digestive enzyme may impact on mite survival.","the scabies mite Sarcoptes scabiei burrows into the skin of its host , obtaining nutrition from host skin and blood . aspartic proteases mediate a range of diverse and essential physiological functions such as tissue invasion and migration, digestion, moulting and reproduction in a number of parasitic organisms . we investigated whether asparticipants may play a role in the digestive processes of host skin . recombinant active enzyme was capable of digesting human haemoglobin, serum albumin, fibrinogen and fibronectin, but not collagen III or laminin . this is consistent with the"
"The sst1, ""supersusceptibility to tuberculosis, "" locus has previously been shown to be a genetic determinant of host resistance to infection with the intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium associated with community acquired pneumonia, and chronic infection with C. pneumoniae has been linked to asthma and atherosclerosis. C. pneumoniae is a highly adapted pathogen that can productively infect macrophages and inhibit host cell apoptosis. Here we examined the role of sst1 in regulating the host response to infection with C. pneumoniae. Although mice carrying the sst1 susceptible (sst1S) locus were not impaired in their ability to clear the acute infection, they were dramatically less tolerant of the induced immune response, displaying higher clinical scores, more severe lung inflammation, exaggerated macrophage and neutrophil influx, and the development of fibrosis compared to wild type mice. This correlated with increased activated caspase-3 in the lungs of infected sst1S mice. Infection of sst1S macrophages with C. pneumoniae resulted in a shift in the secreted cytokine profile towards enhanced production of interferon-b and interleukin-10, and induced apoptotic cell death, which was dependent on secretion of interferon-b. Intriguingly macrophages from the sst1S mice failed to support normal chlamydial growth, resulting in arrested development and failure of the organism to complete its infectious cycle. We conclude that the sst1 locus regulates a shared macrophage-mediated innate defense mechanism against diverse intracellular bacterial pathogens. Its susceptibility allele leads to upregulation of type I interferon pathway, which, in the context of C. pneumoniae, results in decreased tolerance, but not resistance, to the infection. Further dissection of the relationship between type I interferons and host tolerance during infection with intracellular pathogens may provide identification of biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.","Chlamydia pneumoniae is a highly adapted intracellular pathogen and a common cause of atypical, community acquired pneumonia. It has also been suggested as a trigger or promoter of asthma and atherosclerosis. In this study, we examined the role of a genetic locus on mouse chromosome 1 that has been associated with susceptibility to another intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections secondary to Chlamydia pneumoniae. We have determined that a variant at this locus, known as sst1 and associated with destructive pulmonary tuberculosis, makes mice dramatically more sensitive in vivo to the inflammatory changes following respiratory infection with C. pneumoniae. This appears to arise from activation of type I interferons and apoptotic cell death, two signaling pathways that are normally silent during productive C. pneumoniae infection. Despite a noted inability of sst1 susceptible macrophages to support chlamydial development, exuberant lung tissue damage resulted in overall more severe disease in vivo. We conclude the sst1-mediated control of lung tissue damage is an important determinant of the genetic susceptibility of a given host to a number of diverse intracellular bacterial pathogens, which may provide predictors of outcomes to infectious diseases as well as possible target for novel therapeutics.","the sst1, ""supersusceptibility to tuberculosis, "" locus has previously been shown to be a genetic determinant of host resistance to infection with the intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tubercusis . chronic infection with C. pneumoniae has been linked to asthma and atherosclerosis . here we examined the role of st1 in regulating the host response to infections with a highly adapted pathogen that can productively infect macrophages and inhibit host cell apoptotic cell death compared to wild type mice ."
"The recent breakthroughs in assembling long error-prone reads were based on the overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) approach and did not utilize the strengths of the alternative de Bruijn graph approach to genome assembly. Moreover, these studies often assume that applications of the de Bruijn graph approach are limited to short and accurate reads and that the OLC approach is the only practical paradigm for assembling long error-prone reads. We show how to generalize de Bruijn graphs for assembling long error-prone reads and describe the ABruijn assembler, which combines the de Bruijn graph and the OLC approaches and results in accurate genome reconstructions.","Significance When the long reads generated using single-molecule se-quencing ( SMS) technology were made available, most researchers were skeptical about the ability of existing algorithms to generate high-quality assemblies from long error-prone reads.

"Synchronization of 30-80 Hz oscillatory activity of the principle neurons in the olfactory bulb (mitral cells) is believed to be important for odor discrimination. Previous theoretical studies of these fast rhythms in other brain areas have proposed that principle neuron synchrony can be mediated by short-latency, rapidly decaying inhibition. This phasic inhibition provides a narrow time window for the principle neurons to fire, thus promoting synchrony. However, in the olfactory bulb, the inhibitory granule cells produce long lasting, small amplitude, asynchronous and aperiodic inhibitory input and thus the narrow time window that is required to synchronize spiking does not exist. Instead, it has been suggested that correlated output of the granule cells could serve to synchronize uncoupled mitral cells through a mechanism called ""stochastic synchronization"", wherein the synchronization arises through correlation of inputs to two neural oscillators. Almost all work on synchrony due to correlations presumes that the correlation is imposed and fixed. Building on theory and experiments that we and others have developed, we show that increased synchrony in the mitral cells could produce an increase in granule cell activity for those granule cells that share a synchronous group of mitral cells. Common granule cell input increases the input correlation to the mitral cells and hence their synchrony by providing a positive feedback loop in correlation. Thus we demonstrate the emergence and temporal evolution of input correlation in recurrent networks with feedback. We explore several theoretical models of this idea, ranging from spiking models to an analytically tractable model.","Neurons in many parts of the brain fire spikes rhythmically and synchronously in many behaviorally and functionally relevant contexts. There are many mechanisms for producing oscillatory synchronization between populations of biological oscillators. One way to produce synchrony is that the population of oscillators receives common correlated input. In this paper, we study a population of oscillating neurons ( mitral cells) that are not directly coupled to each other but receive broadband correlated input from a second population of neurons ( granule cells) . The granule cell population, in turn, receives inputs from the mitral cells; hence, the mitral and granule cells are reciprocally connected. Correlated input to the oscillating mitral cells produces tighter synchrony in the activity of the mitral cell population. We hypothesize that this increased mitral cell synchrony will evoke greater activity in specific groups of granule cells and that these specific granule cells, in turn, become the source of the correlated input to the mitral cells. That is, the synchronous input from the mitral cells increases the fraction of correlated feedback. Thus, we close the correlation loop. We show through analysis and simulations that this feedback mechanism can lead to the spontaneous appearance of highly synchronous activity within the mitral cells. We show that there is good experimental support for this mechanism in the circuitry of the olfactory bulb. We speculate that such mechanisms could also arise in other parts of the brain.","the olfactory bulb (mitral cells) synchronizes the granule cells through a mechanism called ""stochastic synchronization"" , wherein the correlation arises through correlation of inputs to two neural oscillators . we demonstrate the emergence and temporal evolution of input correlation in recurrent networks with feedback . here we explore several theoretical models of this idea , ranging from spiking models to an analytically tractable model ."
"The initiation of intestinal inflammation involves complex intercellular cross-talk of inflammatory cells, including the epithelial and immune cells, and the gut microbiome. This multicellular complexity has hampered the identification of the trigger that orchestrates the onset of intestinal inflammation. To identify the initiator of inflammatory host-microbiome cross-talk, we leveraged a pathomimetic ""gut inflammation-on-a-chip"" undergoing physiological flow and motions that recapitulates the pathophysiology of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) -induced inflammation in murine models. DSS treatment significantly impaired, without cytotoxic damage, epithelial barrier integrity, villous microarchitecture, and mucus production, which were rapidly recovered after cessation of DSS treatment. We found that the direct contact of DSS-sensitized epithelium and immune cells elevates oxidative stress, in which the luminal microbial stimulation elicited the production of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell recruitment. In contrast, an intact intestinal barrier successfully suppressed oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production against the physiological level of lipopolysaccharide or nonpathogenic Escherichia coli in the presence of immune elements. Probiotic treatment effectively reduced the oxidative stress, but it failed to ameliorate the epithelial barrier dysfunction and proinflammatory response when the probiotic administration happened after the DSS-induced barrier disruption. Maintenance of epithelial barrier function was necessary and sufficient to control the physiological oxidative stress and proinflammatory cascades, suggesting that ""good fences make good neighbors. "" Thus, the modular gut inflammation-on-a-chip identifies the mechanistic contribution of barrier dysfunction mediated by intercellular host-microbiome cross-talk to the onset of intestinal inflammation.","Significance Identification of the trigger of human intestinal inflammation can be a compelling clinical strategy for developing effective and target-specific antiinflammatory therapeutics.

Our discovery suggests that an intact epithelial barrier is necessary to maintain the ""homeostatic tolerance"" in response to physiological host-gut microbiome cross-talks. We also expound an insight of probiotic therapy that the undamaged epithelial barrier is a prerequisite for eliciting the probiotic efficacy. Finally, the gut inflammation-on-a-chip verifies how microphysiological systems can be successfully implemented to dissect the mechanisms of gastrointestinal diseases.","intestinal inflammation involves complex intercellular cross-talk of inflammatory cells, including the epithelial and immune cells, and the gut microbiome . this multicellular complexity has hampered the identification of the trigger that orchestrates the onset of intestinal inflammation . we leveraged a pathomimetic ""gut inflammation-on-a-chip"" undergoing physiological flow and motions that recapitulates the pathophysiology of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) -induced inflammation in murine models . to identify the initiator of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cascades , we found that the direct contact of DSS-sensitized"
"This paper presents Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness 3. 0, which incorporates several advances over previous formulations. IIT starts from phenomenological axioms: information says that each experience is specific - it is what it is by how it differs from alternative experiences; integration says that it is unified - irreducible to non-interdependent components; exclusion says that it has unique borders and a particular spatio-temporal grain. These axioms are formalized into postulates that prescribe how physical mechanisms, such as neurons or logic gates, must be configured to generate experience (phenomenology) . The postulates are used to define intrinsic information as ""differences that make a difference"" within a system, and integrated information as information specified by a whole that cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts. By applying the postulates both at the level of individual mechanisms and at the level of systems of mechanisms, IIT arrives at an identity: an experience is a maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS, a constellation of concepts in qualia space) , and the set of elements that generates it constitutes a complex. According to IIT, a MICS specifies the quality of an experience and integrated information PhMax its quantity. From the theory follow several results, including: a system of mechanisms may condense into a major complex and non-overlapping minor complexes; the concepts that specify the quality of an experience are always about the complex itself and relate only indirectly to the external environment; anatomical connectivity influences complexes and associated MICS; a complex can generate a MICS even if its elements are inactive; simple systems can be minimally conscious; complicated systems can be unconscious; there can be true ""zombies"" - unconscious feed-forward systems that are functionally equivalent to conscious complexes.","Integrated information theory ( IIT) approaches the relationship between consciousness and its physical substrate by first identifying the fundamental properties of experience itself: existence, composition, information, integration, and exclusion. IIT then postulates that the physical substrate of consciousness must satisfy these very properties. We develop a detailed mathematical framework in which composition, information, integration, and exclusion are defined precisely and made operational. This allows us to establish to what extent simple systems of mechanisms, such as logic gates or neuron-like elements, can form complexes that can account for the fundamental properties of consciousness. Based on this principled approach, we show that IIT can explain many known facts about consciousness and the brain, leads to specific predictions, and allows us to infer, at least in principle, both the quantity and quality of consciousness for systems whose causal structure is known. For example, we show that some simple systems can be minimally conscious, some complicated systems can be unconscious, and two different systems can be functionally equivalent, yet one is conscious and the other one is not.","Integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness 3.0 incorporates several advances over previous formulations . this paper presents a plain language summary that is easy to read highlighting key points and removing unnecessary details that can be easily understood by non-medical people . the paper presents the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness 3 0 , a novel formulation of consciousness . it focuses on phenomenological axioms : information says that each experience is specific - it is what it is by how it differs from alternative experiences ; integration says that it is unified - irreducible to non-interdependent components ; exclusion claims that it has unique borders and"
"Histones package DNA and regulate epigenetic states. For the latter, probably the most important histone is H3. Mammals have three near-identical H3 isoforms: canonical H3. 1 and H3. 2, and the replication-independent variant H3. 3. This variant can accumulate in slowly dividing somatic cells, replacing canonical H3. Some replication-independent histones, through their ability to incorporate outside S-phase, are functionally important in the very slowly dividing mammalian germ line. Much remains to be learned of H3. 3 functions in germ cell development. Histone H3. 3 presents a unique genetic paradigm in that two conventional intron-containing genes encode the identical protein. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the developmental effects of null mutations in each of these genes. H3f3a mutants were viable to adulthood. Females were fertile, while males were subfertile with dysmorphic spermatozoa. H3f3b mutants were growth-deficient, dying at birth. H3f3b heterozygotes were also growth-deficient, with males being sterile because of arrest of round spermatids. This sterility was not accompanied by abnormalities in sex chromosome inactivation in meiosis I. Conditional ablation of H3f3b at the beginning of folliculogenesis resulted in zygote cleavage failure, establishing H3f3b as a maternal-effect gene, and revealing a requirement for H3. 3 in the first mitosis. Simultaneous ablation of H3f3a and H3f3b in folliculogenesis resulted in early primary oocyte death, demonstrating a crucial role for H3. 3 in oogenesis. These findings reveal a heavy reliance on H3. 3 for growth, gametogenesis, and fertilization, identifying developmental processes that are particularly susceptible to H3. 3 deficiency. They also reveal partial redundancy in function of H3f3a and H3f3b, with the latter gene being generally the most important.","Histones package DNA and regulate chromosome activity. Histone H3 is particularly important in this regard. The H3. 3 isoform is unique, among H3 histones, in being able to incorporate into chromosomes independent of DNA replication. Thus, in slowly- or non-dividing somatic cells, H3. 3 histone can take on the bulk of H3 functions. The developing germ line is very slowly dividing, and undergoes large-scale changes in chromosome activity. H3. 3 is therefore likely to be very important in regulating these processes. Here, we have studied the effects of null mutations in each of the two genes encoding H3. 3. We demonstrate that H3. 3 is very important in germ cell development, regulating oogenesis, spermatogenesis, and fertilization. Also, we reveal H3. 3 to be important in somatic growth. Each of the two genes is required to varying extents in regulating these processes.","histone H3. 3 presents a unique genetic paradigm in that two conventional intron-containing genes encode the identical protein . here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the developmental effects of null mutations in each of these genes . a complete analysis of these developmental effects revealed a heavy reliance on H3f3a for growth, gametogenesis, and fertilization , identifying developmental processes that are particularly susceptible to H3 deficiency . the latter gene is generally the most important histone : histones package DNA and regulate epigenetic states , and the replication-independent variant H3 isoforms : canonical H3. 1 and H3. 2"
"Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3) is among the most common dominantly inherited ataxias, and is one of nine devastating human neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding glutamine within the gene. The polyglutamine domain confers toxicity on the protein Ataxin-3 leading to neuronal dysfunction and loss. Although modifiers of polyglutamine toxicity have been identified, little is known concerning how the modifiers function mechanistically to affect toxicity. To reveal insight into spinocerebellar ataxia type-3, we performed a genetic screen in Drosophila with pathogenic Ataxin-3-induced neurodegeneration and identified 25 modifiers defining 18 genes. Despite a variety of predicted molecular activities, biological analysis indicated that the modifiers affected protein misfolding. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that some modifiers affected protein accumulation in a manner dependent on the proteasome, whereas others affected autophagy. Select modifiers of Ataxin-3 also affected tau, revealing common pathways between degeneration due to distinct human neurotoxic proteins. These findings provide new insight into molecular pathways of polyQ toxicity, defining novel targets for promoting neuronal survival in human neurodegenerative disease.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 is the most common dominantly inherited movement disorder and is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the gene ATXN3, encoding the Ataxin-3 protein.

The fruit fly Drosophila recapitulates fundamental aspects of the human disease. Here, we performed a genome-wide screen for new modifiers of Ataxin-3 toxicity using the fly and defined 25 modifiers in 18 genes. The majority of the genes belong to chaperone and ubiquitin proteasome pathways, which modulate protein folding and degradation, but the remaining modifiers have a broad range of predicted molecular functions. Assays in vivo revealed that the biological activity of all modifiers converge on aiding in situations of protein misfolding, despite distinct predicted molecular functions. Select modifiers of Ataxin-3 toxicity also modulated tau toxicity associated with Alzheimer disease.

"Background Measles outbreaks continue to occur in countries with high vaccination coverage. Passive immunisation is generally considered to prevent measles in someone who is not immune and has been exposed to infection. Estimates of effectiveness have varied and no minimum effective dose has been determined. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins (passive immunisation) for preventing measles when administered to exposed susceptible people before the onset of symptoms. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 5, 2013), CINAHL (1981 to August 2013) and EMBASE (1974 to August 2013). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and prospective, controlled (cohort) studies if: participants were susceptible and exposed to measles, polyclonal immunoglobulins derived from human sera or plasma were administered intramuscularly or intravenously as the only intervention in at least one group and the number of subsequent measles cases was measured. We excluded studies of other sources of immunoglobulins. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and critically appraised the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing information. We described the results of studies not included in meta-analyses. Main results We included one RCT, two quasi-RCTs and 10 cohort studies (3925 participants). No studies were rated as low risk of bias for all criteria. Critical appraisal was constrained by a lack of information in most studies. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Seven studies (1432 participants) assessed cases of measles after immunoglobulin versus no treatment. Heterogeneity was explained by subgrouping according to the blood product used as an approximation of dose of immunoglobulin. When given within seven days of exposure, immunoglobulins were effective at preventing measles: gamma globulin (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.36), convalescent serum (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.29 to RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.54) and adult serum (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.59). The differences in the effectiveness of different blood products were supported by studies not included in the meta-analysis and by two studies (702 participants) that found gamma globulin more effective than serum (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69). Based on three studies (893 participants) immunoglobulin was effective at preventing death due to measles compared to no treatment (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.44). Two studies included measles vaccine alone among the intervention groups. Meta-analysis could not be undertaken. Both studies suggested the vaccine was more effective than gamma globulin. No serious adverse events were observed in any of the included studies, although reporting of adverse events was poor overall. Non-serious adverse events included transient fever, rash, muscle stiffness, local redness and induration. Authors' conclusions Passive immunisation within seven days of exposure is effective at preventing measles, with the risk for non-immune people up to 83% less than if no treatment is given. Given an attack rate of 45 per 1000 (per the control group of the most recent included study), gamma globulin compared to no treatment has an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 37 per 1000 and a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 27. Given an attack rate of 759 per 1000 (per the attack rate of the other included study assessing gamma globulin), the ARR of gamma globulin compared to no treatment is 629 and the NNTB is two. It seems the dose of immunoglobulin administered impacts on effectiveness. A minimum effective dose of measles-specific antibodies could not be identified. Passive immunisation is effective at preventing deaths from measles, reducing the risk by 76% compared to no treatment. Whether the benefits of passive immunisation vary among subgroups of non-immune exposed people could not be determined. Due to a paucity of evidence comparing vaccine to passive immunisation, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding relative effectiveness. The included studies were not specifically designed to detect adverse events. Future research should consider the effectiveness of passive immunisation for preventing measles in high-risk populations such as pregnant women, immunocompromised people and infants. Further efforts should be made to determine the minimum effective dose of measles-specific antibodies for post-exposure prophylaxis and the relative effectiveness of vaccine compared to immunoglobulin.","Antibodies for preventing measles after exposure People who have had measles, or measles vaccine, have antibodies against the virus in their blood that protect them from developing measles should they come into contact with it. These antibodies can be extracted from blood donated by these individuals. If people without antibodies come into contact with someone who is contagious with measles, they are likely to contract the disease. Measles is usually debilitating and can have serious consequences including death, so preventing it is desirable. One way of preventing measles in this group, when they do come into contact with a contagious person, is to inject them with antibodies that have been extracted from blood donations. This has been practised since the 1920s, but measures of its effectiveness have varied and the minimum amount of antibodies that we can give to prevent measles is unknown. Based on seven studies (1432 people), of overall moderate quality, injecting antibodies into a muscle of people who came into contact with measles, but lacked their own antibodies, was effective at preventing them catching the disease compared to those who received no treatment. Using the modern day antibody preparation, people were 83% less likely to develop measles than those who were not treated. It was very effective at preventing them developing complications if they did contract measles and very effective at preventing death. The included studies generally did not intend to measure possible harms from the injections. Minor side effects were reported, such as muscle stiffness, redness around the injection site, fever and rash. Importantly, only two studies compared the measles vaccine with the antibody injection in this group of people, so no firm conclusions could be drawn about the relative effectiveness of these interventions. The antibody injection is often recommended for pregnant women, infants and immunocompromised people (if they do not have their own antibodies to measles and come into contact with someone who is contagious with measles). The included studies did not include these groups of people, so it is unknown whether the effectiveness of antibody injections is different for them. We were also unable to identify the minimum dose of antibodies required as only one study measured the specific amount of measles antibodies in the injections and one other study estimated this figure; the results of these two studies were not consistent. The evidence is current to August 2013.","objectiveto assess the effectiveness and safety of intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins (passive immunisation) for preventing measles when administered to exposed susceptible people before the onset of symptoms.materials and methodswe searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (46 to July week 5, 2013) and CINAHL (81 to August 2013) . randomised controlled trials (RCTs ) and prospective, controlled (cohort) studies if participants were susceptible and exposed to meases.resultswe included one RCT, two quasi-RCT and 10 cohort studies (1432 participants) that found "
"Gibbon species have accumulated an unusually high number of chromosomal changes since diverging from the common hominoid ancestor 15-18 million years ago. The cause of this increased rate of chromosomal rearrangements is not known, nor is it known if genome architecture has a role. To address this question, we analyzed sequences spanning 57 breaks of synteny between northern white-cheeked gibbons (Nomascus l. leucogenys) and humans. We find that the breakpoint regions are enriched in segmental duplications and repeats, with Alu elements being the most abundant. Alus located near the gibbon breakpoints (<150 bp) have a higher CpG content than other Alus. Bisulphite allelic sequencing reveals that these gibbon Alus have a lower average density of methylated cytosine that their human orthologues. The finding of higher CpG content and lower average CpG methylation suggests that the gibbon Alu elements are epigenetically distinct from their human orthologues. The association between undermethylation and chromosomal rearrangement in gibbons suggests a correlation between epigenetic state and structural genome variation in evolution.","Mammalian genomes are remarkably stable ( with few exceptions) . In humans, wrong recombination events occur quite rarely, manifesting themselves in genomic disorders or cancer. On exceptional occasions, the rate of genome evolution has been accelerated by genome-wide reshuffling events giving rise to some highly derivative karyotypes. The genomes of gibbon species ( Hylobatidae) are an example of accelerated genome structural evolution; gibbons display a rate of chromosome evolution 10-20 fold higher than the default rate found in mammals ( one chromosome change every 4 million years) . As we are interested in investigating the possible genetic causes of this phenomenon, we sequenced a considerable number of chromosomal breakpoints in the northern white-cheeked gibbon genome and analyzed the genomic features of these sites. We observe that the gibbon breakpoints are mostly associated with endogenous retrotransposons called Alus, which are normally abundant in the genomes of primates. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that gibbon Alus have a lower content of methylated CpG when compared to the orthologous human Alus. In mammals, CpG methylation is known to be responsible for keeping retrotransposons in a repressed state and protect genome integrity. We therefore suggest that a glitch in the methylation apparatus might have driven the higher genome recombination in gibbons.","we analyzed sequences spanning 57 breaks of synteny between northern white-cheeked gibbons (Nomascus l. leucogenys) and humans . we find that the breakpoint regions are enriched in segmental duplications and repeats , with alu elements being the most abundant . the finding of higher CpG content and lower average methylation suggests that these gibbon Alus are epigenetically distinct from their human orthologues ."
"UNC-6/Netrin is a conserved axon guidance cue that directs growth cone migrations in the dorsal-ventral axis of C. elegans and in the vertebrate spinal cord. UNC-6/Netrin is expressed in ventral cells, and growth cones migrate ventrally toward or dorsally away from UNC-6/Netrin. Recent studies of growth cone behavior during outgrowth in vivo in C. elegans have led to a polarity/protrusion model in directed growth cone migration away from UNC-6/Netrin. In this model, UNC-6/Netrin first polarizes the growth cone via the UNC-5 receptor, leading to dorsally biased protrusion and F-actin accumulation. UNC-6/Netrin then regulates protrusion based on this polarity. The receptor UNC-40/DCC drives protrusion dorsally, away from the UNC-6/Netrin source, and the UNC-5 receptor inhibits protrusion ventrally, near the UNC-6/Netrin source, resulting in dorsal migration. UNC-5 inhibits protrusion in part by excluding microtubules from the growth cone, which are pro-protrusive. Here we report that the RHO-1/RhoA GTPase and its activator GEF RHGF-1 inhibit growth cone protrusion and MT accumulation in growth cones, similar to UNC-5. However, growth cone polarity of protrusion and F-actin were unaffected by RHO-1 and RHGF-1. Thus, RHO-1 signaling acts specifically as a negative regulator of protrusion and MT accumulation, and not polarity. Genetic interactions are consistent with RHO-1 and RHGF-1 acting with UNC-5, as well as with a parallel pathway, to regulate protrusion. The cytoskeletal interacting molecule UNC-33/CRMP was required for RHO-1 activity to inhibit MT accumulation, suggesting that UNC-33/CRMP might act downstream of RHO-1. In sum, these studies describe a new role of RHO-1 and RHGF-1 in regulation of growth cone protrusion by UNC-6/Netrin.","Neural circuits are formed by precise connections between axons. During axon formation, the growth cone leads the axon to its proper target in a process called axon guidance. Growth cone outgrowth involves asymmetric protrusion driven by extracellular cues that stimulate and inhibit protrusion. How guidance cues regulate growth cone protrusion in neural circuit formation is incompletely understood. This work shows that the signaling molecule RHO-1 acts downstream of the UNC-6/Netrin guidance cue to inhibit growth cone protrusion in part by excluding microtubules from the growth cone, which are structural elements that drive protrusion.","the cytoskeletal interacting molecule UNC-33/CRMP was required for RHO-1 activity to inhibit growth cone protrusion and MT accumulation in growth cones . this study describes a new role of the receptor UNC-6/Netrin in regulation of growth cone polarity . in this study , we report that the receptor RHO-1/RhoA GTPase and its activator GEF RHGF-1 inhibited growth cone proliferation , resulting in dorsal migration ."
"Replicating viruses have broad applications in biomedicine, notably in cancer virotherapy and in the design of attenuated vaccines; however, uncontrolled virus replication in vulnerable tissues can give pathology and often restricts the use of potent strains. Increased knowledge of tissue-selective microRNA expression now affords the possibility of engineering replicating viruses that are attenuated at the RNA level in sites of potential pathology, but retain wild-type replication activity at sites not expressing the relevant microRNA. To assess the usefulness of this approach for the DNA virus adenovirus, we have engineered a hepatocyte-safe wild-type adenovirus 5 (Ad5) , which normally mediates significant toxicity and is potentially lethal in mice. To do this, we have included binding sites for hepatocyte-selective microRNA mir-122 within the 3' UTR of the E1A transcription cassette. Imaging versions of these viruses, produced by fusing E1A with luciferase, showed that inclusion of mir-122 binding sites caused up to 80-fold decreased hepatic expression of E1A following intravenous delivery to mice. Animals administered a ten-times lethal dose of wild-type Ad5 (5x1010 viral particles/mouse) showed substantial hepatic genome replication and extensive liver pathology, while inclusion of 4 microRNA binding sites decreased replication 50-fold and virtually abrogated liver toxicity. This modified wild-type virus retained full activity within cancer cells and provided a potent, liver-safe oncolytic virus. In addition to providing many potent new viruses for cancer virotherapy, microRNA control of virus replication should provide a new strategy for designing safe attenuated vaccines applied across a broad range of viral diseases.","Attenuated viruses have found important applications in medicine, including their use as vaccines ( notably for measles, mumps, polio, influenza, and chicken pox) and their experimental development as selective cancer-killing agents, so-called ""virotherapy. "" Wild-type versions are often most effective in both of these settings; however, attenuated viruses have usually been developed to decrease the risk of significant viral pathology. Recent advances in understanding regulation of gene expression by microRNA now afford the possibility to design viruses that are ""selectively attenuated"" in sites of potential pathology, by engineering them for inhibition by microRNA molecules that are expressed there. Here we have engineered wild-type adenovirus for recognition by a microRNA expressed in hepatocytes, producing a virus that retains wild-type infection and replication at sites of therapeutic activity ( such as cancer cells) but is severely attenuated in hepatocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. This virus caused no significant liver toxicity to mice even when applied at ten times the lethal dose of wild-type virus. The ability to produce replication-competent viruses with key toxicities removed should provide a new platform for development of improved cancer treatments and better vaccines for a broad range of viral diseases.","a hepatocyte-safe wild-type adenovirus 5 (Ad5) , which normally mediates significant toxicity and is potentially lethal in mice , has been engineered . to assess the usefulness of this approach for the DNA virus adenoma , we have included binding sites for hepocyte-selective microRNA mir-122 within the 3' UTR of the E1A transcription cassette . we have engineered the hepatic-safe ad5 (ad5) and a potent oncolytic virus . a new strategy for designing safe attenuated vaccines applied across a broad range of"
"While we have come to appreciate the architectural complexity of microbially synthesized secondary metabolites, far less attention has been paid to linking their structural features with possible modes of action. This is certainly the case with tropodithietic acid (TDA) , a broad-spectrum antibiotic generated by marine bacteria that engage in dynamic symbioses with microscopic algae. TDA promotes algal health by killing unwanted marine pathogens; however, its mode of action (MoA) and significance for the survival of an algal-bacterial miniecosystem remains unknown. Using cytological profiling, we herein determine the MoA of TDA and surprisingly find that it acts by a mechanism similar to polyether antibiotics, which are structurally highly divergent. We show that like polyether drugs, TDA collapses the proton motive force by a proton antiport mechanism, in which extracellular protons are exchanged for cytoplasmic cations. The a-carboxy-tropone substructure is ideal for this purpose as the proton can be carried on the carboxyl group, whereas the basicity of the tropylium ion facilitates cation export. Based on similarities to polyether anticancer agents we have further examined TDA's cytotoxicity and find it to exhibit potent, broad-spectrum anticancer activities. These results highlight the power of MoA-profiling technologies in repurposing old drugs for new targets. In addition, we identify an operon that confers TDA resistance to the producing marine bacteria. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses of these genes lead to a previously unknown metabolic link between TDA/acid resistance and the g-glutamyl cycle. The implications of this resistance mechanism in the context of the algal-bacterial symbiosis are discussed.","Significance The roseobacter constitute nearly 25% of marine bacteria in coastal areas. They have been shown to produce a potent antibiotic, tropodithietic acid ( TDA) , which confers far-reaching aquacultural and ecological benefits. We have examined the mode of action of TDA using a number of methods including bacterial cytological profiling. Surprisingly, TDA clusters with molecules that are structurally unrelated and highly cytotoxic. Subsequent screens demonstrate that, aside from its antibacterial activity, TDA is also a potent, broad-range, and potentially useful anticancer agent. Our studies highlight the power of profiling methods in repurposing bioactive compounds, reveal the mode of action of the unusual troponoid TDA, and uncover a previously unknown link between two metabolic cycles, which together provide TDA resistance to the producing roseobacter.","tropodithietic acid (TDA) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic generated by marine bacteria that engage in dynamic symbioses with microscopic algae . however , its mode of action (MoA) and significance for the survival of an algal-bacterial miniecosystem remains unknown . we herein determine the moA of TDA and surprisingly find that it acts by a mechanism similar to polyether anticancer agents , in which extracellular protons are exchanged for cytoplasmic cations . the a-carboxy-tropone substructure is ideal for this purpose as the proton can be carried on the carboxy"
"Extracellular vesicles (EV) mediate intercellular communication events and alterations in normal vesicle content contribute to function and disease initiation or progression. The ability to package a variety of cargo and transmit molecular information between cells renders EVs important mediators of cell-to-cell crosstalk. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is a chief viral oncoprotein expressed in most Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -associated cancers and is released from cells at high levels in EVs. LMP1 containing EVs have been demonstrated to promote cell growth, migration, differentiation, and regulate immune cell function. Despite these significant changes in recipient cells induced by LMP1 modified EVs, the mechanism how this viral oncogene modulates the recipient cells towards these phenotypes is not well understood. We hypothesize that LMP1 alters EV content and following uptake of the LMP1-modified EVs by the recipient cells results in the activation of cell signaling pathways and increased gene expression which modulates the biological properties of recipient cell towards a new phenotype. Our results show that LMP1 expression alters the EV protein and microRNA content packaged into EVs. The LMP1-modified EVs also enhance recipient cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, invasion concomitant with the activation of ERK, AKT, and NF-kB signaling pathways. The LMP1 containing EVs induced transcriptome reprogramming in the recipient cells by altering gene expression of different targets including cadherins, matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) , MMP2 and integrin-a5 which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Altogether, our data demonstrate the mechanism in which LMP1-modified EVs reshape the tumor microenvironment by increasing gene expression of ECM interaction proteins.","Extracellular vesicles ( EV) facilitate cell-to-cell crosstalk due to their capability to sort and transfer various cargoes. Multiple studies have shown changes in EV content and cargo affect their functions and contribute to pathological conditions such as cancer. EVs represent a mechanism through which cancer cells modify their microenvironment to enhance growth and metastasis. This study showed that LMP1, an EBV major oncoprotein which is released in EVs alters the EV content and cargo leading enhanced cell attachment, proliferation, migration and invasion. LMP1 modified EVs mediate the transfer of signaling molecules to recipient cells where they induce NF-kB, AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways leading to alteration in gene expression especially those involved in ECM interaction.

"Signaling networks that convert graded stimuli into binary, all-or-none cellular responses are critical in processes ranging from cell-cycle control to lineage commitment. To exhaustively enumerate topologies that exhibit this switch-like behavior, we simulated all possible two- and three-component networks on random parameter sets, and assessed the resulting response profiles for both steepness (ultrasensitivity) and extent of memory (bistability) . Simulations were used to study purely enzymatic networks, purely transcriptional networks, and hybrid enzymatic/transcriptional networks, and the topologies in each class were rank ordered by parametric robustness (i. e. , the percentage of applied parameter sets exhibiting ultrasensitivity or bistability) . Results reveal that the distribution of network robustness is highly skewed, with the most robust topologies clustering into a small number of motifs. Hybrid networks are the most robust in generating ultrasensitivity (up to 28%) and bistability (up to 18%) ; strikingly, a purely transcriptional framework is the most fragile in generating either ultrasensitive (up to 3%) or bistable (up to 1%) responses. The disparity in robustness among the network classes is due in part to zero-order ultrasensitivity, an enzyme-specific phenomenon, which repeatedly emerges as a particularly robust mechanism for generating nonlinearity and can act as a building block for switch-like responses. We also highlight experimentally studied examples of topologies enabling switching behavior, in both native and synthetic systems, that rank highly in our simulations. This unbiased approach for identifying topologies capable of a given response may be useful in discovering new natural motifs and in designing robust synthetic gene networks.","Biomolecular signaling networks enable cells to mediate responses to extracellular and intracellular stimuli and are hence crucial for the functioning of all organisms. Such networks do not merely forward information, but perform signal processing: specific modules have evolved to produce complex, dynamic behaviors from input cues. Switching, or the conversion of a graded stimulus into a binary, all-or-none response, is a ubiquitous behavior that regulates critical processes ranging from cell division to stem cell differentiation. While a number of switch-generating networks have been identified, a comprehensive understanding of network architectures that can yield switch-like behavior remains elusive. In this work, we assessed the entire space of minimal networks to identify architectures that can not only exhibit switching behavior but can do so robustly in the dynamic and noisy cellular environment. Our results reveal that these robust networks fit into a small number of topological motifs. Furthermore, network composition ( i. e. , whether a signaling component functions as an enzyme or a transcription factor) can dramatically impact robustness in generating switching behavior. Topologies presented in this work can be used to identify additional circuits in nature that may exhibit switching behavior and suggest design strategies for engineering switching behavior in synthetic circuits.","background : signaling networks that convert graded stimuli into binary, all-or-none cellular responses are critical in processes ranging from cell-cycle control to lineage commitment . to exhaustively enumerate topologies that exhibit this switch-like behavior , we simulated all possible two- and three-component networks on random parameter sets , and assessed the resulting response profiles for both steepness (ultrasensitivity) and extent of memory (bistability ) . simulations were used to study purely enzymatic networks, purely transcriptional networks, and hybrid networks exhibiting ultrasensitivity or bistability . we also highlight experimentally studied examples of top"
"The Government of Rwanda reported an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Eastern Province in 2018. To respond to the outbreak, vaccination and education campaigns about the disease were carried out. Because RVF cases continue to be detected in Rwanda and the disease impacts livelihoods and health, accurate knowledge and communication are imperative. The objectives of this study were to evaluate knowledge and risk perceptions of RVF transmission among livestock farmers in Nyagatare District, Eastern Province, Rwanda, and to compare RVF knowledge, risk perceptions, and farming practices between male and female livestock farmers. This cross-sectional, quantitative study was conducted in selected sectors of Nyagatare District in the Eastern Province of Rwanda in June 2019. A 34-question survey was used to ask about demographics, livestock ownership, risk perceptions about zoonotic diseases and livestock management, RVF knowledge, preferred communication sources and information sharing strategies, and protective strategies for RVF mitigation while working with livestock. Livestock farmers were interviewed at three milk collection centers, two village meeting points, a farm cooperative meeting, and during door-to-door visits in villages. In total, 123 livestock farmers were interviewed. The survey found that most livestock farmers lacked knowledge about epizootic and zoonotic transmission of RVF, more male livestock farmers were familiar with RVF and risk mitigation strategies, and female livestock farmers are not viewed as reliable sources of information. Additionally, most livestock farmers had not vaccinated their animals against RVF despite past vaccination campaigns. Radio was the most popular communication channel. These findings show that RVF knowledge and information sharing are inadequate among livestock farmers in Eastern Province. Therefore, vaccination and education campaigns may need to be reevaluated within the context of these trends in order to prepare for future RVF outbreaks.","This study was conducted in order to evaluate RVF knowledge and awareness as well as communication and mitigation strategies among livestock farmers in Eastern Province, Rwanda. Rwanda declared an outbreak of RVF in 2018 and cases have continued to be detected. Thus, evaluating the status of knowledge, preventive strategies, and information sharing among livestock farmers is crucial in mitigating future outbreaks. Our team conducted a survey of knowledge, risk perceptions, mitigation strategies, and communication practices among livestock farmers from selected sectors within Nyagatare District and compared them between male and female livestock farmers in order to analyze gender-nuanced differences between these groups. Sectors were chosen for sampling based on their proximity to previous outbreak areas. Survey questionnaire results showed that knowledge and risk perceptions differed between male and female livestock farmers, and that they could be generally improved among all livestock farmers. Female livestock farmers and non-farming community members were viewed as unreliable sources of information which could impact information dissemination. Many farmers also reported that their livestock herds were not vaccinated for the disease despite previous vaccination campaigns. Communication strategies and information sources also differed between male and female livestock farmers, which highlights a need to consider gender in improving RVF vaccination and education campaign coverage. These findings pose implications for future community-based public health interventions as well as policy development for RVF control and mitigating future RVF outbreaks within Rwanda.","background and objectives : to evaluate knowledge and risk perceptions of RVF transmission among livestock farmers in Nyagatare District, Eastern Province, Rwanda , and to compare RVF knowledge , risks perceptions, and farming practices between male and female livestock farmers.materials and methods : a cross-sectional, quantitative study was conducted in selected sectors of the Eastern Province of Rwanda in June 2019.results:a 34-question survey was used to ask about demographics, livestock ownership, risk perception of zoonotic diseases and livestock management , RVF awareness, preferred communication sources and information sharing strategies, and protective strategies for RVF mitigation while working with livestock . 123 livestock farmers"
"Background Evidence is required on the cost-effectiveness of alternative changes to the blood collection service. Objectives (1) To estimate the cost-effectiveness of alternative minimum interdonation intervals between whole-blood donations. (2) To investigate donors' frequency of whole-blood donation according to alternative changes to the blood collection service. (3) To estimate the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for maintaining the supply of whole blood. Methods We undertook a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the INTERVAL trial, stated preference (SP) surveys to elicit donor preferences and a CEA of different strategies for blood collection. The strategies considered were reduced minimum intervals between whole-blood donations, introduction of a donor health report and changes to appointment availability and opening times at blood collection venues. The within-trial CEA included 44, 863 donors, with men randomly assigned to 12- versus 10- versus 8-week interdonation intervals, and women to 16- versus 14- versus 12-week interdonation intervals. We undertook a SP survey of non-INTERVAL donors (100, 000 invitees) . We asked donors to state the frequency with which they would be willing to donate blood, according to the service attribute and level. The CEA compared changes to the blood service with current practice by combining the survey estimates with information from the NHS Blood and Transpant database (PULSE) and cost data. The target population was existing whole-blood donors in England, of whom approximately 85% currently donate whole blood at mobile (temporary) blood collection venues, with the remainder donating at static (permanent) blood collection centres. We reported the effects of the alternative strategies on the number of whole-blood donations, costs and cost-effectiveness. Results The reduced donation interval strategies had higher deferral rates caused by low haemoglobin (Hb) , but increased frequency of successful donation. For men in the 8- versus 12-week arm of the INTERVAL trial [Di Angelantonio E, Thompson SG, Kaptoge S, Moore C, Walker M, Armitage J, et al. Efficiency and safety of varying the frequency of whole blood donation (INTERVAL) : a randomised trial of 45 000 donors. Lancet 2017; 390: 2360-71], the Hb-related deferral rate was 5. 7% per session versus 2. 6% per session, but the average number of donations over 2 years increased by 1. 71 (95% confidence interval 1. 60 to 1. 80) . A total of 25, 187 (25%) donors responded to the SP survey. For static donor centres, extending appointment availability to weekday evenings or weekends, or reduced intervals between blood donations, increased stated donation frequency by, on average, 0. 5 donations per year. The CEA found that reducing the minimum interval, extending opening times to weekday evenings and extending opening times to weekends in all static donor centres would provide additional whole blood at a cost per additional unit of PS10, PS23 and PS29, respectively, with similar results for donors with high-demand blood types. Limitations The study did not consider the long-term rates at which donors will leave the donation register, for example following higher rates of Hb-related deferral. Conclusions Extending opening hours for blood donation to weekday evenings or weekends for all static donor centres are cost-effective ways of increasing the supply of high-demand blood types. Future work To monitor the effects of new strategies on long-term donation frequency.","Blood transfusions are important in many aspects of NHS care, including general surgery and organ transplantation. Overall demand for blood is decreasing, and demand for particular blood types is also growing. To increase the supply of high-demand blood, NHS Blood and Transplant is considering potential service changes to encourage donors to give blood more often. The separate INTERVAL study of 45, 000 blood donors investigated the safety of donating blood more frequently than currently allowed. This study looked at the costs of each potential service, and also surveyed 32, 924 blood donors, to estimate the impact on the amount of blood collected. The study used data from these surveys, the INTERVAL study and donors' current donation records, as well as cost information, to report which possible service changes were best value for money. Donors give blood at either a 'static donor centre' or a 'mobile session' ( where blood is collected by a team who travel around to different venues) . The study found that donors at static donor centres would donate more if centres were open on weekday evenings or at weekends, and this would be a relatively cost-effective way of increasing the supply of blood that is in high demand. Giving donors a health report ( e. g. with measurements such as blood pressure or cholesterol) would not be cost-effective. Some donors said that they would stop donating if changes to the blood collection service meant that they had to travel for longer to donate blood. Allowing donors to donate more often could increase the supply of blood in the short term. However, more donors would be turned away from appointments because of low iron, which may lead them to stop donating, and so it is unclear whether or not this would be a cost-effective way to increase the supply of blood in the long term.","objectiveto estimate the cost-effectiveness of alternative minimum interdonation intervals between whole-blood donations.materials and methodswe undertook a within-trial cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the INTERVAL trial, stated preference surveys to elicit donor preferences and a CEA of different strategies for blood collection.resultswe asked non-INTErVAL donors to state the frequency with which they would be willing to donate blood according to the service attribute and level.research design and methodsa total of 25, 187 (25%) donors responded to the SP survey . we found that reducing the minimum interval, extending opening times to weekday evenings and extending"
"Dengue fever is a major public health problem in tropical/subtropical regions. Prior economic analyses have predominantly evaluated either vaccination or vector-control programmes in isolation and do not really consider the incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of mixed strategies and combination control. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of single and combined approaches in Thailand. The impacts of different control interventions were analysed using a previously published mathematical model of dengue epidemiology and control incorporating seasonality, age structure, consecutive infection, cross protection, immune enhancement and combined vector-host transmission. An economic model was applied to simulation results to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 4 interventions and their various combinations (6 strategies) : i) routine vaccination of 1-year olds; ii) chemical vector control strategies targeting adult and larval stages separately; iii) environmental management/ public health education and awareness [EM/ PHEA]) . Payer and societal perspectives were considered. The health burden of dengue fever was assessed using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. Costs and effects were assessed for 10 years. Costs were discounted at 3% annually and updated to 2013 United States Dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out after strategies were rank-ordered by cost, with results presented in a table of incremental analysis. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were undertaken; and the impact and cost-effectiveness of Wolbachia was evaluated in exploratory scenario analyses. From the payer and societal perspectives, 2 combination strategies were considered optimal, as all other control strategies were dominated. Vaccination plus adulticide plus EM/ PHEA was deemed cost-effective according to multiple cost-effectiveness criteria. From the societal perspective, incremental differences vs. adulticide and EM/ PHEA resulted in costs of $157. 6 million and DALYs lost of 12, 599, giving an expected ICER of $12, 508 per DALY averted. Exploratory scenario analyses showed Wolbachia to be highly cost-effective ($343 per DALY averted) vs. other single control measures. Our model shows that individual interventions can be cost-effective, but that important epidemiological reductions and economic impacts are demonstrated when interventions are combined as part of an integrated approach to combating dengue fever. Exploratory scenario analyses demonstrated the potential epidemiological and cost-effective impact of Wolbachia when deployed at scale on a nationwide basis. Our findings were robust in the face of sensitivity analyses.","Dengue fever has become a major public health problem. It is considered one of the most important mosquito-borne viral diseases and occurs in >100 countries in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia-Pacific, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa with >3 billion people at risk. Despite current control interventions against dengue fever in endemic countries, the disease is associated with considerable healthcare utilisation, personal costs to patients and caregivers, productivity loss and human suffering. Whilst the illness is well understood, there is also recognition that current control efforts focussing predominantly on Aedes aegypti control and elimination are less than optimal although may still have an important role to play in the short to medium term. In this study, we consider the cost-effectiveness of individual as well as mixed dengue control strategies in Thailand, embracing chemical interventions, public health education/ environmental control and paediatric vaccination using a dengue vaccine profile broadly consistent with ( dengue) vaccines in late stage development. To anticipate the transition to possible new vector control technologies, we also carry out exploratory scenario analyses of the impact and cost-effectiveness of the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes ( which are less capable of spreading viruses) . Our findings indicate that single dengue control interventions can be cost-effective weapons in reducing dengue infections, although their effectiveness may be additionally enhanced when combined.","background : dengue fever is a major public health problem in tropical/subtropical regions . prior economic analyses have predominantly evaluated either vaccination or vector-control programmes in isolation and do not really consider the incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of single and combined approaches in Thailand.methods:a previously published mathematical model of dengue epidemiology and control incorporating seasonality, age structure, consecutive infection, cross protection, immune enhancement and combined vector-host transmission.results:the impact of different control interventions was analysed using a previously reported mathematical model : i) routine vaccination of 1-year olds; iii) chemical vector control strategies targeting adult and larval stages separately; "
"The current outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in Upper West Africa is the largest ever recorded. Molecular evidence suggests spread has been almost exclusively through human-to-human contact. Social factors are thus clearly important to understand the epidemic and ways in which it might be stopped, but these factors have so far been little analyzed. The present paper focuses on Sierra Leone, and provides cross sectional data on the least understood part of the epidemic--the largely undocumented spread of Ebola in rural areas. Various forms of social networking in rural communities and their relevance for understanding pathways of transmission are described. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between marriage, funerals and land tenure. Funerals are known to be a high-risk factor for infection. It is suggested that more than a shift in awareness of risks will be needed to change local patterns of behavior, especially in regard to funerals, since these are central to the consolidation of community ties. A concluding discussion relates the information presented to plans for halting the disease. Local consultation and access are seen as major challenges to be addressed.","Ebola virus disease is a disease of social intimacy. The main infection pathways are through nursing of the sick and through preparation of corpses for burial. In African rural communities these are activities mainly undertaken by close family members. Infection thus spreads to those most intimate with the patient. In effect, Ebola virus disease exacts a high price for family loyalty. It also causes a potential breach between family members and the authorities responsible for imposing infection control. Understanding the social pathways through which infection spreads, and the conflict of human values invoked by infection control are thus key topics in managing the current Ebola epidemic in Upper West Africa. The paper offers a picture, based on case study data from central Sierra Leone, of some of the social factors to be taken into account in efforts to control the epidemic.","the current outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in Upper West Africa is the largest ever recorded .

"The available Leptospira multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme supported by a MLST website is limited to L. interrogans and L. kirschneri. Our aim was to broaden the utility of this scheme to incorporate a total of seven pathogenic species. We modified the existing scheme by replacing one of the seven MLST loci (fadD was changed to caiB) , as the former gene did not appear to be present in some pathogenic species. Comparison of the original and modified schemes using data for L. interrogans and L. kirschneri demonstrated that the discriminatory power of the two schemes was not significantly different. The modified scheme was used to further characterize 325 isolates (L. alexanderi [n = 5], L. borgpetersenii [n = 34], L. interrogans [n = 222], L. kirschneri [n = 29], L. noguchii [n = 9], L. santarosai [n = 10], and L. weilii [n = 16]) . Phylogenetic analysis using concatenated sequences of the 7 loci demonstrated that each species corresponded to a discrete clade, and that no strains were misclassified at the species level. Comparison between genotype and serovar was possible for 254 isolates. Of the 31 sequence types (STs) represented by at least two isolates, 18 STs included isolates assigned to two or three different serovars. Conversely, 14 serovars were identified that contained between 2 to 10 different STs. New observations were made on the global phylogeography of Leptospira spp. , and the utility of MLST in making associations between human disease and specific maintenance hosts was demonstrated. The new MLST scheme, supported by an updated MLST website, allows the characterization and species assignment of isolates of the seven major pathogenic species associated with leptospirosis.","Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease worldwide. Genotyping of the causative organisms provides important insights into disease transmission and informs preventive strategies and vaccine development. Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST) is the most widespread genotyping methodology for bacterial pathogens, but the Leptospira scheme supported by a public MLST database is currently only applicable to L. interrogans and L. kirschneri. The purpose of this study was to extend the scheme to a total of seven pathogenic Leptospira species. This was achieved through the development of a modified scheme in which one of the seven MLST loci was replaced, together with newly designed primers for the remaining 6 loci. Comparison of the original and modified scheme demonstrated that they were very similar, hence sequence type ( ST) assignments were largely carried over to the modified scheme. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from concatenated sequences of the seven loci of the modified scheme demonstrated perfect classification of isolates into seven pathogenic species, which resided in clearly distinct phylogenetic clusters. Congruence was low between STs and serovars.

"Humans make sense of the world by organizing things into categories. When and how does this process begin? We investigated whether real-world object categories that spontaneously emerge in the first months of life match categorical representations of objects in the human visual cortex. Using eye tracking, we measured the differential looking time of 4-, 10-, and 19-mo-olds as they looked at pairs of pictures belonging to eight animate or inanimate categories (human/nonhuman, faces/bodies, real-world size big/small, natural/artificial) . Taking infants' looking times as a measure of similarity, for each age group, we defined a representational space where each object was defined in relation to others of the same or of a different category. This space was compared with hypothesis-based and functional MRI-based models of visual object categorization in the adults' visual cortex. Analyses across different age groups showed that, as infants grow older, their looking behavior matches neural representations in ever-larger portions of the adult visual cortex, suggesting progressive recruitment and integration of more and more feature spaces distributed over the visual cortex. Moreover, the results characterize infants' visual categorization as an incremental process with two milestones. Between 4 and 10 mo, visual exploration guided by saliency gives way to an organization according to the animate-inanimate distinction. Between 10 and 19 mo, a category spurt leads toward a mature organization. We propose that these changes underlie the coupling between seeing and thinking in the developing mind.","Significance Categorization is the basis of thinking and reasoning. Through the analysis of infants' gaze, we describe the trajectory through which visual object representations in infancy incrementally match categorical object representations as mapped onto adults' visual cortex. Using a methodological approach that allows for a comparison of findings obtained with behavioral and brain measures in infants and adults, we identify the transition from visual exploration guided by perceptual salience to an organization of objects by categories, which begins with the animate-inanimate distinction in the first months of life and continues with a spurt of biologically relevant categories ( human bodies, nonhuman bodies, nonhuman faces, small natural objects) through the second year of life.","we investigated whether real-world object categories that spontaneously emerge in the first months of life match categorical representations of objects in the human visual cortex . utilizing eye tracking , we measured the differential looking time of 4-, 10-, and 19-mo-olds as they looked at pairs of pictures belonging to eight animate or inanimate categories (human/nonhuman, faces/bodies, real -world size big/small, natural/artificial) . we defined a representational space where each object was defined in relation to others of the same or of a different category . this space was compared with hypothesis-based and functional MRI-based models of visual object"
"Mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) greatly affect humans and animals worldwide. The life cycle of mycobacteria is complex and the mechanisms resulting in pathogen infection and survival in host cells are not fully understood. Recently, comparative genomics analyses have provided new insights into the evolution and adaptation of the MTBC to survive inside the host. However, most of this information has been obtained using M. tuberculosis but not other members of the MTBC such as M. bovis and M. caprae. In this study, the genome of three M. bovis (MB1, MB3, MB4) and one M. caprae (MB2) field isolates with different lesion score, prevalence and host distribution phenotypes were sequenced. Genome sequence information was used for whole-genome and protein-targeted comparative genomics analysis with the aim of finding correlates with phenotypic variation with potential implications for tuberculosis (TB) disease risk assessment and control. At the whole-genome level the results of the first comparative genomics study of field isolates of M. bovis including M. caprae showed that as previously reported for M. tuberculosis, sequential chromosomal nucleotide substitutions were the main driver of the M. bovis genome evolution. The phylogenetic analysis provided a strong support for the M. bovis/M. caprae clade, but supported M. caprae as a separate species. The comparison of the MB1 and MB4 isolates revealed differences in genome sequence, including gene families that are important for bacterial infection and transmission, thus highlighting differences with functional implications between isolates otherwise classified with the same spoligotype. Strategic protein-targeted analysis using the ESX or type VII secretion system, proteins linking stress response with lipid metabolism, host T cell epitopes of mycobacteria, antigens and peptidoglycan assembly protein identified new genetic markers and candidate vaccine antigens that warrant further study to develop tools to evaluate risks for TB disease caused by M. bovis/M. caprae and for TB control in humans and animals.","Mycobacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infect humans and animals since pre-history and are a serious health problem worldwide. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomics generate information on the evolution and molecular basis of pathogenicity and transmissibility. However, while genomic information is increasingly available for the main human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, little is known about closely related bacteria, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium caprae. These mycobacteria infect humans causing zoonotic tuberculosis and are the main causative agents of animal tuberculosis. Although human-to-human transmission of zoonotic tuberculosis is limited, the infection often causes extra-pulmonary disease in humans and is still a major public health concern in developing countries, causing not only human disease but also severe effects on livelihoods. In this study, whole-genome sequences and targeted comparative genomics of three Mycobacterium bovis and one Mycobacterium caprae field isolates generated new information on the evolution and phenotypic variation of these mycobacteria. The results identified new genetic markers and candidate vaccine antigens that warrant further study to develop tools to evaluate risks for tuberculosis caused by M. bovis/M. caprae and for disease control in humans and animals.","the genome of three M. bovis ( MB1, MB3, MB4) and one M. caprae (MB2) field isolates with different lesion score, prevalence and host distribution phenotypes were sequenced . genome sequence information was used for whole-genome and protein-targeted comparative genomics analysis with the aim of finding correlates with gene families that are important for bacterial infection and transmission , thus highlighting differences with functional implications between isolates otherwise classified with the same spoligotype . the comparison of the MB1 and MB4 isolates revealed differences in genome sequence with potential implications for tuberculosis ( TB) disease risk"
"This paper presents the development of an agent-based model (ABM) to investigate Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis (rHAT) disease transmission. The ABM model, fitted at a fine spatial scale, was used to explore the impact of a growing host population on the spread of disease along a 75 km transect in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia. The model was used to gain a greater understanding of how increases in human and domestic animal population could impact the contact network between vector and host, the subsequent transmission patterns, and disease incidence outcomes in the region. Modelled incidence rates showed increases in rHAT transmission in both humans and cattle. The primary demographic attribution of infection switched dramatically from young children of both sexes attending school, to adult women performing activities with shorter but more frequent trips, such as water and firewood collection, with men more protected due to the presence of cattle in their routines. The interpretation of model output provides a plausible insight into both population development and disease transmission in the near future in the region and such techniques could aid well-targeted mitigation strategies in the future.","African trypanosomiasis is a parasitic disease which affects humans and other animals in 36 sub-Saharan African countries. The disease is transmitted by the tsetse fly, and the human form of the disease is known as sleeping sickness. With human and animal populations growing across Africa, demand for space to settle is on the rise, and people are being forced to occupy increasingly marginal spaces. This behaviour has the potential to increase exposure to pre-existing biological hazards, including vector-borne diseases. This investigation utilises agent-based modelling techniques to investigate the implications of a growing and spreading human and animal population in a region affected by Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis. The model incorporates previously developed spatial data for the Luangwa Valley case study in Zambia, along with demographic data for its current inhabitants, and a detailed, seasonally-driven tsetse lifecycle. Tsetse and potential human and animal hosts are modelled at the individual level, allowing each contact and infection to be recorded through time. By modelling at a fine-scale, we can incorporate detailed mechanisms for tsetse birth, feeding, reproduction and death, as well as a realistic theoretical human and domestic animal population increase, before considering the possible spatial and demographic impact.","this paper presents the development of an agent-based model (ABM) to investigate trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense human africa trypanostomiasis (rHAT) disease transmission . the model was used to gain a greater understanding of how increases in human and domestic animal population could impact the contact network between vector and host, the subsequent transmission patterns, and disease incidence outcomes in the region . modelled incidence rates showed increases in rHAt transmission in both humans and cattle ."
"Cytometry analysis has seen a considerable expansion in recent years in the maximum number of parameters that can be acquired in a single experiment. In response to this technological advance there has been an increased effort to develop new computational methodologies for handling high-dimensional single cell data acquired by flow or mass cytometry. Despite the success of numerous algorithms and published packages to replicate and outperform traditional manual analysis, widespread adoption of these techniques has yet to be realised in the field of immunology. Here we present CytoPy, a Python framework for automated analysis of cytometry data that integrates a document-based database for a data-centric and iterative analytical environment. In addition, our algorithm-agnostic design provides a platform for open-source cytometry bioinformatics in the Python ecosystem. We demonstrate the ability of CytoPy to phenotype T cell subsets in whole blood samples even in the presence of significant batch effects due to technical and user variation. The complete analytical pipeline was then used to immunophenotype the local inflammatory infiltrate in individuals with and without acute bacterial infection. CytoPy is open-source and licensed under the MIT license. CytoPy is available at https: //github. com/burtonrj/CytoPy, with notebooks accompanying this manuscript and software documentation at https: //cytopy. readthedocs. io/.","Cytometry is a popular technology used to quantify biological material.

"Background Febrile neutropenia (FN) and other infectious complications are some of the most serious treatment-related toxicities of chemotherapy for cancer, with a mortality rate of 2% to 21%. The two main types of prophylactic regimens are granulocyte (macrophage) colony-stimulating factors (G(M)-CSF) and antibiotics, frequently quinolones or cotrimoxazole. Current guidelines recommend the use of colony-stimulating factors when the risk of febrile neutropenia is above 20%, but they do not mention the use of antibiotics. However, both regimens have been shown to reduce the incidence of infections. Since no systematic review has compared the two regimens, a systematic review was undertaken. Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of G(M)-CSF compared to antibiotics in cancer patients receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, databases of ongoing trials, and conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology (1980 to December 2015). We planned to include both full-text and abstract publications. Two review authors independently screened search results. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prophylaxis with G(M)-CSF versus antibiotics for the prevention of infection in cancer patients of all ages receiving chemotherapy. All study arms had to receive identical chemotherapy regimes and other supportive care. We included full-text, abstracts, and unpublished data if sufficient information on study design, participant characteristics, interventions and outcomes was available. We excluded cross-over trials, quasi-randomised trials and post-hoc retrospective trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the results of the search strategies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and analysed data according to standard Cochrane methods. We did final interpretation together with an experienced clinician. Main results In this updated review, we included no new randomised controlled trials. We included two trials in the review, one with 40 breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and G-CSF compared to antibiotics, a second one evaluating 155 patients with small-cell lung cancer receiving GM-CSF or antibiotics. We judge the overall risk of bias as high in the G-CSF trial, as neither patients nor physicians were blinded and not all included patients were analysed as randomised (7 out of 40 patients). We considered the overall risk of bias in the GM-CSF to be moderate, because of the risk of performance bias (neither patients nor personnel were blinded), but low risk of selection and attrition bias. For the trial comparing G-CSF to antibiotics, all cause mortality was not reported. There was no evidence of a difference for infection-related mortality, with zero events in each arm. Microbiologically or clinically documented infections, severe infections, quality of life, and adverse events were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in frequency of febrile neutropenia (risk ratio (RR) 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 2.84). The quality of the evidence for the two reported outcomes, infection-related mortality and frequency of febrile neutropenia, was very low, due to the low number of patients evaluated (high imprecision) and the high risk of bias. There was no evidence of a difference in terms of median survival time in the trial comparing GM-CSF and antibiotics. Two-year survival times were 6% (0 to 12%) in both arms (high imprecision, low quality of evidence). There were four toxic deaths in the GM-CSF arm and three in the antibiotics arm (3.8%), without evidence of a difference (RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.30 to 5.69; P = 0.71; low quality of evidence). There were 28% grade III or IV infections in the GM-CSF arm and 18% in the antibiotics arm, without any evidence of a difference (RR 1.55; 95% CI 0.86 to 2.80; P = 0.15, low quality of evidence). There were 5 episodes out of 360 cycles of grade IV infections in the GM-CSF arm and 3 episodes out of 334 cycles in the cotrimoxazole arm (0.8%), with no evidence of a difference (RR 1.55; 95% CI 0.37 to 6.42; P = 0.55; low quality of evidence). There was no significant difference between the two arms for non-haematological toxicities like diarrhoea, stomatitis, infections, neurologic, respiratory, or cardiac adverse events. Grade III and IV thrombopenia occurred significantly more frequently in the GM-CSF arm (60.8%) compared to the antibiotics arm (28.9%); (RR 2.10; 95% CI 1.41 to 3.12; P = 0.0002; low quality of evidence). Neither infection-related mortality, incidence of febrile neutropenia, nor quality of life were reported in this trial. Authors' conclusions As we only found two small trials with 195 patients altogether, no conclusion for clinical practice is possible. More trials are necessary to assess the benefits and harms of G(M)-CSF compared to antibiotics for infection prevention in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.","Prophylactic antibiotics or G(M)-CSF for the prevention of infections in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy Review question We reviewed the existing literature examining the efficacy and safety of granulocyte (macrophage) colony-stimulating factors (G(M)-CSF) compared to antibiotics to prevent infections for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Background Cancer treatment with chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) disrupts the immune system and lowers white blood cell counts. This increases a person's risk of infection. Both G(M)-CSF and antibiotics can reduce the risk of infection associated with cancer treatments. The review compared the efficacy of antibiotics to G(M)-CSFs for the prevention of infection. Study characteristics We searched several medical databases and identified two randomised controlled trials (RCT) that met our inclusion criteria; no new trials were identified for this review update. One trial included 40 breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy. Eighteen patients received G-CSF and 22 got antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and amphotericin) to prevent infection. Another trial evaluated GM-CSF versus antibiotics in patients with small-cell lung cancer, with 78 patients in the GM-CSF arm and 77 patients in the antibiotics arm. Key results The study that analysed G-CSF versus antibiotics did not report all cause mortality, microbiologically or clinically documented infections, severe infections, quality of life, or adverse events. We found no evidence of a difference between the two prophylactic options for the outcomes of infection-related mortality (no patient died because of infection), or febrile neutropenia. The trial that assessed GM-CSF versus antibiotics did not found any evidence of a difference in all cause mortality, trial mortality, infections, or severe infections. The only difference between the two arms was found for the adverse event thrombocytopenia, favouring patients receiving antibiotics. Quality of life was not reported in this trial. More research is needed to determine the best prevention against infection in cancer patients. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence for infection-related mortality and frequency of febrile neutropenia in the G-CSF trial was very low, because of the small number of patients that were evaluated, and the study design (high risk of bias). The trial that analysed GM-CSF versus antibiotics reported overall survival, toxic deaths, infections, severe infections, and adverse events. Because of the very small number of patients included, we judged that the overall quality for all these outcomes was low. The evidence is current to December 2015.","background Febrile neutropenia ( FN) and other infectious complications are some of the most serious treatment-related toxicities of chemotherapy for cancer , with a mortality rate of 2% to 21% . the two main types of prophylactic regimens are granulocyte (macrophage) colony-stimulating factors (G(M)-CSF) and antibiotics , frequently quinolones or cotrimoxazole . since no systematic review has compared the two regimens, a systematic review was undertaken.resultswe included two trials in the review, one with 40 breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and "
"Family with sequence similarity 20, -member C (FAM20C) is highly expressed in the mineralized tissues of mammals. Genetic studies showed that the loss-of-function mutations in FAM20C were associated with human lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia (Raine Syndrome) , implying an inhibitory role of this molecule in bone formation. However, in vitro gain- and loss-of-function studies suggested that FAM20C promotes the differentiation and mineralization of mouse mesenchymal cells and odontoblasts. Recently, we generated Fam20c conditional knockout (cKO) mice in which Fam20c was globally inactivated (by crossbreeding with Sox2-Cre mice) or inactivated specifically in the mineralized tissues (by crossbreeding with 3. 6 kb Col 1a1-Cre mice) . Fam20c transgenic mice were also generated and crossbred with Fam20c cKO mice to introduce the transgene in the knockout background. In vitro gain- and loss-of-function were examined by adding recombinant FAM20C to MC3T3-E1 cells and by lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of FAM20C in human and mouse osteogenic cell lines. Surprisingly, both the global and mineralized tissue-specific cKO mice developed hypophosphatemic rickets (but not osteosclerosis) , along with a significant downregulation of osteoblast differentiation markers and a dramatic elevation of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) in the serum and bone. The mice expressing the Fam20c transgene in the wild-type background showed no abnormalities, while the expression of the Fam20c transgene fully rescued the skeletal defects in the cKO mice. Recombinant FAM20C promoted the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. Knockdown of FAM20C led to a remarkable downregulation of DMP1, along with a significant upregulation of FGF23 in both human and mouse osteogenic cell lines. These results indicate that FAM20C is a bone formation ""promoter"" but not an ""inhibitor"" in mouse osteogenesis. We conclude that FAM20C may regulate osteogenesis through its direct role in facilitating osteoblast differentiation and its systemic regulation of phosphate homeostasis via the mediation of FGF23.","A recent study demonstrated that the inactivating mutations in the FAM20C gene were associated with lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia characterized by a generalized hardening of all bones; this observation implied an inhibitory role of FAM20C during bone formation. However, in vitro studies revealed a contradictory finding that FAM20C accelerated the differentiation of cells forming the mineralized tissues. Here we generated Fam20c conditional knockout ( cKO) mice, in which the gene was inactivated either in all tissues or specifically in the mineralized tissues. We also generated recombinant FAM20C protein and Fam20c transgenic mice. The cKO mice did not mimic the human skeleton abnormalities of osteosclerotic bone dysplasia, but exhibited rickets ( softer bone) along with a significant reduction of serum phosphate level and a remarkable elevation of serum FGF23, a hormone known to promote phosphate wasting. A number of differentiation markers of the bone-forming cells were downregulated in the cKO mice. Recombinant FAM20C promoted the differentiation of mouse preosteoblasts. Introducing the Fam20c transgene did not lead to any abnormalities but rescued the bone defects of the cKO mice. Taken together, we conclude that FAM20C promotes the differentiation of osteoblast lineages and regulates phosphate homeostasis via the mediation of FGF23.","a family with sequence similarity 20, -member C (FAM20C) is highly expressed in the mineralized tissues of mammals . genetic studies showed that the loss-of-function mutations in FAM20C were associated with human lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia (Raine syndrome ) , implying an inhibitory role of this molecule in bone formation . however , in vitro gain- and loss of-function studies suggested that FAM 20C promotes the differentiation and mineralization of mouse mesenchymal cells and odontoblasts . recently , we generated Fam20c conditional knockout (cKO) mice"
"Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted parasite that colonizes the human urogential tract where it remains extracellular and adheres to epithelial cells. Infections range from asymptomatic to highly inflammatory, depending on the host and the parasite strain. Here, we use a combination of methodologies including cell fractionation, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, RNA, proteomic and cytokine analyses and cell adherence assays to examine pathogenic properties of T. vaginalis. We have found that T. vaginalis produces and secretes microvesicles with physical and biochemical properties similar to mammalian exosomes. The parasite-derived exosomes are characterized by the presence of RNA and core, conserved exosomal proteins as well as parasite-specific proteins. We demonstrate that T. vaginalis exosomes fuse with and deliver their contents to host cells and modulate host cell immune responses. Moreover, exosomes from highly adherent parasite strains increase the adherence of poorly adherent parasites to vaginal and prostate epithelial cells. In contrast, exosomes from poorly adherent strains had no measurable effect on parasite adherence. Exosomes from parasite strains that preferentially bind prostate cells increased binding of parasites to these cells relative to vaginal cells. In addition to establishing that parasite exosomes act to modulate host: parasite interactions, these studies are the first to reveal a potential role for exosomes in promoting parasite: parasite communication and host cell colonization.","Trichomoniasis, the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease worldwide, infects over 275 million people annually. Infection results from the colonization of the human urogenital tract by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. To establish and maintain infection the parasite adheres to host cells, a process that is poorly understood. Here, we show that T. vaginalis secretes small vesicles called exosomes that are capable of fusing with and delivering their contents to host cells. Parasite exosomes were found to induce changes in the host cell and to mediate the interaction of T. vaginalis with host by increasing the adherence of the parasite to host cells. Exosomes have been primarily studied in mammalian cells where they have been shown to mediate intercellular communication and have been implicated in processes including development, antigen presentation and cancer metastasis. Our data extend the function of exosomes to mediating host: parasite interactions, cellular communication between two species and promoting colonization of an extracellular parasite. Research on T. vaginalis exosomes holds the potential for developing applications that would allow exosomes to be used in detecting and diagnosing trichomoniasis and for targeting drugs to the site of infection.","trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted parasite that colonizes the human urogential tract where it remains extracellular and adheres to epithelial cells . infections range from asymptomatic to highly inflammatory, depending on the host and the parasite strain . here, we use a combination of methodologies including cell fractionation, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, RNA, proteomic and cytokine analyses and cell adherence assays to examine pathogenic properties of T. vaginale . we demonstrate that parasite exosomes fuse with and deliver their contents to host cells and modulate host cell"
"ZAP-70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70) is a tyrosine kinase that interacts directly with the activated T-cell receptor to transduce downstream signals, and is hence a major player in the regulation of the adaptive immune response. Dysfunction of ZAP-70 causes selective T cell deficiency that in turn results in persistent infections. ZAP-70 is activated by a variety of signals including phosphorylation of the kinase domain (KD) , and binding of its regulatory tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains to the T cell receptor. The present study investigates molecular mechanisms of activation and inhibition of ZAP-70 via atomically detailed molecular dynamics simulation approaches. We report microsecond timescale simulations of five distinct states of the ZAP-70 KD, comprising apo, inhibited and three phosphorylated variants. Extensive analysis of local flexibility and correlated motions reveal crucial transitions between the states, thus elucidating crucial steps in the activation mechanism of the ZAP-70 KD. Furthermore, we rationalize previously observed staurosporine-bound crystal structures, suggesting that whilst the KD superficially resembles an ""active-like"" conformation, the inhibitor modulates the underlying protein dynamics and restricts it in a compact, rigid state inaccessible to ligands or cofactors. Finally, our analysis reveals a novel, potentially druggable pocket in close proximity to the activation loop of the kinase, and we subsequently use its structure in fragment-based virtual screening to develop a pharmacophore model. The pocket is distinct from classical type I or type II kinase pockets, and its discovery offers promise in future design of specific kinase inhibitors, whilst mutations in residues associated with this pocket are implicated in immunodeficiency in humans.","ZAP-70 is a key protein kinase in the adaptive immune system. It is essential for development and function of T cells and natural killer cells, and associated mutations can lead to conditions such as severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID) . Here, simulations of the ZAP-70 kinase domain are used to study its dynamics in response to different mechanistic signals. We identify crucial motions over microsecond timescales, which help to rationalize in atomic detail previous structural and experimental data regarding its biological regulation. We subsequently propose a scheme for the phosphorylation-dependent activation cascade of ZAP-70, and for its ligand-dependent inhibition. Finally, we characterize a novel cryptic pocket adjacent to the active site and activation loop, which is distinct from classical type I or type II kinase sites. The pocket is in close proximity to several residues whose mutations cause SCID in humans, and its identification offers promise in future drug design efforts.","the present study investigates molecular mechanisms of activation and inhibition of the ZAP-70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70) via atomically detailed simulation approaches . we report microsecond timescale simulations of five distinct states of the cytokine domain ( apo ) , inhibited and three phosphorylated variants . a novel, potentially druggable pocket in close proximity to the activation loop of a tyrosporine-bound crystal structures , suggesting that whilst the KD superficially resembles an ""active-like conformation, the inhibitor modulates the underlying protein dynamics and"

"Kleiber's law describes the scaling of metabolic rate with body size across several orders of magnitude in size and across taxa and is widely regarded as a fundamental law in biology. The physiological origins of Kleiber's law are still debated and generalizations of the law accounting for deviations from the scaling behavior have been proposed. Most theoretical and experimental studies of Kleiber's law, however, have focused on the relationship between the average body size of a species and its mean metabolic rate, neglecting intraspecific variation of these 2 traits. Here, we propose a theoretical characterization of such variation and report on proof-of-concept experiments with freshwater phytoplankton supporting such framework. We performed joint measurements at the single-cell level of cell volume and nitrogen/carbon uptake rates, as proxies of metabolic rates, of 3 phytoplankton species using nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and stable isotope labeling. Common scaling features of the distribution of nutrient uptake rates and cell volume are found to hold across 3 orders of magnitude in cell size. Once individual measurements of cell volume and nutrient uptake rate within a species are appropriately rescaled by a function of the average cell volume within each species, we find that intraspecific distributions of cell volume and metabolic rates collapse onto a universal curve. Based on the experimental results, this work provides the building blocks for a generalized form of Kleiber's law incorporating intraspecific, correlated variations of nutrient-uptake rates and body sizes.","Significance Empirical laws predicting metabolic rates of a species by its average body mass neglect intraspecies variability arising from the range of physiologically feasible rates and phenotypic heterogeneity. We describe an exploratory experimental test of a theory that explicitly accounts for such variations. We show, by single-cell joint measurements of mass and uptake rates, how marginal distributions of mass and rates collapse onto a common master distribution for species spanning 3 orders of magnitude in cell volume.

"A previous survey for clinical cases of Buruli ulcer (BU) in the Mape Basin of Cameroon suggested that, compared to older age groups, very young children may be less exposed to Mycobacterium ulcerans. Here we determined serum IgG titres against the 18 kDa small heat shock protein (shsp) of M. ulcerans in 875 individuals living in the BU endemic river basins of the Mape in Cameroon and the Densu in Ghana. While none of the sera collected from children below the age of four contained significant amounts of 18 kDa shsp specific antibodies, the majority of sera had high IgG titres against the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) . These data suggest that exposure to M. ulcerans increases at an age which coincides with the children moving further away from their homes and having more intense environmental contact, including exposure to water bodies at the periphery of their villages.","Although M. ulcerans, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer ( BU) , was identified in 1948, its transmission pathways and environmental reservoirs remain poorly understood. The occurrence of M. ulcerans infections in endemic countries in West and Central Africa is highly focal and associated with stagnant and slow flowing water bodies. BU is often described as a disease mainly affecting children <15 years of age. However, taking the population age distribution into account, our recent longitudinal survey for BU in the Mape Dam Region of Cameroon revealed that clinical cases of BU among children <5 years are relatively rare. In accordance with these findings, data of the present sero-epidemiological study indicate that children <4 years old are less exposed to M. ulcerans than older children. Sero-conversion is associated with age, which may be due to age-related changes in behavioural factors, such as a wider movement radius of older children, including more frequent contact with water bodies at the periphery of their villages.",background and objectives : to determine serum IgG titres against the 18 kDa small heat shock protein (shsp) of M. ulcerans in 875 individuals living in the BU endemic river basins of the Mape in cameroon and the Densu in Ghana.methods:we determined serum IggG titre against the kda small temperature shock protein of Ms. ulceran in 825 individuals living within the endemi river basin of the mape in Cameroun and the densu of Ghana.results:the majority of the sera collected from children below the age of four contained significant amounts of 18.kD
"Optimal immune activation of naive CD8 T cells requires signal 1 mediated by the T cell receptor, signal 2 mediated by co-stimulation and signal 3 provided by pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the potential for signal 3 cytokines to rescue anti-viral responses in functionally exhausted T cells has not been defined. We investigated the effect of using third signal cytokines IL-12 or IFN-a to rescue the exhausted CD8 T cell response characteristic of patients persistently infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) . We found that IL-12, but not IFN-a, potently augmented the capacity of HBV-specific CD8 T cells to produce effector cytokines upon stimulation by cognate antigen. Functional recovery mediated by IL-12 was accompanied by down-modulation of the hallmark inhibitory receptor PD-1 and an increase in the transcription factor T-bet. PD-1 down-regulation was observed in HBV but not CMV-specific T cells, in line with our finding that the highly functional CMV response was not further enhanced by IL-12. IL-12 enhanced a number of characteristics of HBV-specific T cells important for viral control: cytotoxicity, polyfunctionality and multispecificity. Furthermore, IL-12 significantly decreased the pro-apoptotic molecule Bim, which is capable of mediating premature attrition of HBV-specific CD8 T cells. Combining IL-12 with blockade of the PD-1 pathway further increased CD8 functionality in the majority of patients. These data provide new insights into the distinct signalling requirements of exhausted T cells and the potential to recover responses optimised to control persistent viral infections.","Persistent viral infections continue to cause major morbidity and mortality; chronic hepatitis B virus infection alone accounts for more than a million deaths annually. Such infections are characterised by a failure of viral control perpetuated by exhaustion of the T cell response. Here we show that the cytokine IL-12 can act as a potent ""third signal"" to rescue antiviral function in exhausted T cells. IL-12 has previously been shown to enhance naive T cell responses but this is the first demonstration of its capacity to boost the disabled antiviral response in a persistent viral infection. IL-12 was able to down-regulate PD-1, a key inhibitory receptor driving T cell exhaustion, resulting in the recovery of hepatitis B virus-specific responses able to mediate multiple antiviral functions. Control responses in the same patients directed against the well-controlled cytomegalovirus did not require IL-12 to function efficiently. Our findings therefore elucidate a role for IL-12 in re-programming functionally exhausted T cells in persistent viral infections.","we investigated the effect of using third signal cytokines IL-12 or IFN-a to rescue the exhausted CD8 T cell response characteristic of patients persistently infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV ) . we found that il-12, but not IL-a, potently augmented the capacity of HBV-specific CD8 cells to produce effector cytokines upon stimulation by cognate antigen . a number of characteristics of hv-specific T cells important for viral control: cytotoxicity, polyfunctionality and multispecificity . combined with blockade of the PD-1 pathway further increased the pro-apopt"
"Malignant osteolysis associated with inoperable primary bone tumors and multifocal skeletal metastases remains a challenging clinical problem in cancer patients. Nanomedicine that is able to target and deliver therapeutic agents to diseased bone sites could potentially provide an effective treatment option for different types of skeletal cancers. Here, we report the development of polylactide nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with doxorubicin (Doxo) and coated with bone-seeking pamidronate (Pam) for the targeted treatment of malignant skeletal tumors. In vivo biodistribution of radiolabeled targeted Pam-NPs demonstrated enhanced bone tumor accumulation and prolonged retention compared with nontargeted NPs. In a murine model of focal malignant osteolysis, Pam-functionalized, Doxo-loaded NPs (Pam-Doxo-NPs) significantly attenuated localized osteosarcoma (OS) progression compared with nontargeted Doxo-NPs. Importantly, we report on the first evaluation to our knowlege of Pam-Doxo-NPs in dogs with OS, which possess tumors of anatomic size and physiology comparable to those in humans. The repeat dosing of Pam-Doxo-NPs in dogs with naturally occurring OS indicated the therapeutic was well tolerated without hematologic, nonhematologic, and cardiac toxicities. By nuclear scintigraphy, the biodistribution of Pam-Doxo-NPs demonstrated malignant bone-targeting capability and exerted measurable anticancer activities as confirmed with percent tumor necrosis histopathology assessment.","Significance Malignant osteolysis associated with inoperable primary bone tumors and multifocal skeletal metastases remains a challenging clinical problem in cancer patients.

"Malaria infection induces complex and diverse immune responses. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying host-parasite interaction, we performed a genetic screen during early (24 h) Plasmodium yoelii infection in mice and identified a large number of interacting host and parasite genes/loci after transspecies expression quantitative trait locus (Ts-eQTL) analysis. We next investigated a host E3 ubiquitin ligase gene (March1) that was clustered with interferon (IFN) -stimulated genes (ISGs) based on the similarity of the genome-wide pattern of logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores (GPLS) . March1 inhibits MAVS/STING/TRIF-induced type I IFN (IFN-I) signaling in vitro and in vivo. However, in malaria-infected hosts, deficiency of March1 reduces IFN-I production by activating inhibitors such as SOCS1, USP18, and TRIM24 and by altering immune cell populations. March1 deficiency increases CD86^+DC (dendritic cell) populations and levels of IFN-g and interleukin 10 (IL-10) at day 4 post infection, leading to improved host survival. T cell depletion reduces IFN-g level and reverse the protective effects of March1 deficiency, which can also be achieved by antibody neutralization of IFN-g. This study reveals functions of MARCH1 (membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger 1) in innate immune responses and provides potential avenues for activating antimalaria immunity and enhancing vaccine efficacy.","Significance Malaria kills ~0. 4 million people a year.

"Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments is an essential goal of population and quantitative genetics. While technological advances now allow interrogation of genome-wide genotyping data in large panels, our understanding of the process of polygenic adaptation is still limited. To address this limitation, we use extensive forward-time simulation to explore the impacts of variation in demography, trait genetics, and selection on the rate and mode of adaptation and the resulting genetic architecture. We simulate a population adapting to an optimum shift, modeling sequence variation for 20 QTL for each of 12 different demographies for 100 different traits varying in the effect size distribution of new mutations, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the contribution of the genomic background. We then use random forest regression approaches to learn the relative importance of input parameters in determining a number of aspects of the process of adaptation, including the speed of adaptation, the relative frequency of hard sweeps and sweeps from standing variation, or the final genetic architecture of the trait. We find that selective sweeps occur even for traits under relatively weak selection and where the genetic background explains most of the variation. Though most sweeps occur from variation segregating in the ancestral population, new mutations can be important for traits under strong stabilizing selection that undergo a large optimum shift. We also show that population bottlenecks and expansion impact overall genetic variation as well as the relative importance of sweeps from standing variation and the speed with which adaptation can occur. We then compare our results to two traits under selection during maize domestication, showing that our simulations qualitatively recapitulate differences between them. Overall, our results underscore the complex population genetics of individual loci in even relatively simple quantitative trait models, but provide a glimpse into the factors that drive this complexity and the potential of these approaches for understanding polygenic adaptation.","Many traits are controlled by a large number of genes, and environmental changes can lead to shifts in trait optima. How populations adapt to these shifts depends on a number of parameters including the genetic basis of the trait as well as population demography. We simulate a number of trait architectures and population histories to study the genetics of adaptation to distant trait optima. We find that selective sweeps occur even in traits under relatively weak selection and our machine learning analyses find that demography and the effect sizes of mutations have the largest influence on genetic variation after adaptation. Maize domestication is a well suited model for trait adaptation accompanied by demographic changes. We show how two example traits under a maize specific demography adapt to a distant optimum and demonstrate that polygenic adaptation is a well suited model for crop domestication even for traits with major effect loci.","background : understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments is an essential goal of population and quantitative genetics . while technological advances now allow interrogation of genome-wide genotyping data in large panels, our understanding of the process of polygenic adaptation is still limited . to address this limitation, we use extensive forward-time simulation to explore the impacts of variation in demography, trait genetics, and selection on the rate and mode of adaptation and the resulting genetic architecture.methods:we simulate a population adapting to an optimum shift , modeling sequence variation for 20 QTL for each of 12 different demographies for 100 different traits varying in the effect size distribution of new"

Here, we demonstrate that CD4+ T cell-associated HIV-1 RNA is often highly enriched in cells expressing CD30, and that cells expressing this marker considerably contribute to the total pool of transcriptionally active CD4+ lymphocytes in individuals on suppressive ART. Using in situ RNA hybridization studies, we show co-localization of CD30 with HIV-1 transcriptional activity in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. We also demonstrate that ex vivo treatment with brentuximab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets CD30, significantly reduces the total amount of HIV-1 DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from infected, ART-suppressed individuals. Finally, we observed that an HIV-1-infected individual, who received repeated brentuximab vedotin infusions for lymphoma, had no detectable virus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Overall, CD30 may be a marker of residual, transcriptionally active HIV-1 infected cells in the setting of suppressive ART. Given that CD30 is only expressed on a small number of total mononuclear cells, it is a potential therapeutic target of persistent HIV-1 infection.","Previous studies have shown that higher levels of soluble CD30 are associated with HIV-1 disease progression. Many of these studies, however, were performed prior to the implementation of combination ART, and the relationship between surface CD30 expression, soluble CD30 and HIV-1 infection in ART suppressed individuals, or those with viremic control off ART, is not known. We demonstrate that cell-associated HIV-1 RNA is highly enriched in CD4+ T cells expressing CD30, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily.

"Despite the enormous potential shown by recent biorefineries, the current bioeconomy still encounters multifaceted challenges. To develop a sustainable biorefinery in the future, multidisciplinary research will be essential to tackle technical difficulties. Herein, we leveraged a known plant genetic engineering approach that results in aldehyde-rich lignin via down-regulation of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and disruption of monolignol biosynthesis. We also report on renewable deep eutectic solvents (DESs) synthesized from phenolic aldehydes that can be obtained from CAD mutant biomass. The transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana CAD mutant was pretreated with the DESs and showed a twofold increase in the yield of fermentable sugars compared with wild type (WT) upon enzymatic saccharification. Integrated use of low-recalcitrance engineered biomass, characterized by its aldehyde-type lignin subunits, in combination with a DES-based pretreatment, was found to be an effective approach for producing a high yield of sugars typically used for cellulosic biofuels and biobased chemicals. This study demonstrates that integration of renewable DES with plant genetic engineering is a promising strategy in developing a closed-loop process.","Significance Deep eutectic solvents ( DESs) have gained increasing attention due to their application-friendly properties, including universal solvating capabilities and wide tunability. Additionally, ease of synthesis and broad availability from inexpensive chemical components could render DESs more versatile solvents for biomass pretreatment, as compared with traditional ionic liquids. Because the long-term success of the biorefinery depends on the development of sustainable processes to convert lignocellulosics into biofuels, DESs derived from renewable sources such as lignin are highly desirable.

"Schistosomes, parasitic flatworms that cause the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis, have been considered to have an entirely carbohydrate based metabolism, with glycolysis playing a dominant role in the adult parasites. However, we have discovered a close link between mitochondrial oxygen consumption by female schistosomes and their ability to produce eggs. We show that oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and egg production are significantly diminished by pharmacologic inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) , which catalyzes a rate limiting step in fatty acid b-oxidation (FAO) and by genetic loss of function of acyl CoA synthetase, which complexes with CPT1 and activates long chain FA for use in FAO, and of acyl CoA dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the first step in FAO within mitochondria. Declines in OCR and egg production correlate with changes in a network of lipid droplets within cells in a specialized reproductive organ, the vitellarium. Our data point to the importance of regulated lipid stores and FAO for the compartmentalized process of egg production in schistosomes.","Schistosomes are parasitic worms that are the cause of the Neglected Tropical Disease schistosomiasis. Female schistosomes mated with males produce eggs, which either pass out of the host's body for transmission of the infection, or become trapped in host tissues, where they induce inflammation that contributes to disease symptoms. It has been assumed that egg production is a bioenergetically-demanding process fuelled by glucose metabolism. However, we have discovered that egg production is blocked by inhibition of fatty acid oxidation ( FAO) , the process through which FA are utilized within mitochondria to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle and thereby produce substrates for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent with a role for FAO in egg production, fecund females have extensive fat stores, in the form of lipid droplets, whereas virgin adult females have little or no fat reserves. Moreover, fecund females placed into tissue culture exhaust their fat reserves and cease to be able to produce eggs. Since schistosomes cannot produce their own FA, our data point to the acquisition of FA from the host as a key process necessary for egg production. Our findings point to the importance of regulated lipid stores and FAO for egg production by schistosomes.","we show that mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and egg production are significantly diminished by pharmacologic inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) , which catalyzes a rate limiting step in fatty acid b-oxidation (FAO) and by genetic loss of function of acyl CoA synthetases . we suggest that regulated lipid stores and FAO are essential for the compartmentalized process of egg production in schistosomes ."
"The genetic code relates nucleotide sequence to amino acid sequence and is shared across all organisms, with the rare exceptions of lineages in which one or a few codons have acquired novel assignments. Recoding of UGA from stop to tryptophan has evolved independently in certain reduced bacterial genomes, including those of the mycoplasmas and some mitochondria. Small genomes typically exhibit low guanine plus cytosine (GC) content, and this bias in base composition has been proposed to drive UGA Stop to Tryptophan (Stop-Trp) recoding. Using a combination of genome sequencing and high-throughput proteomics, we show that an a-Proteobacterial symbiont of cicadas has the unprecedented combination of an extremely small genome (144 kb) , a GC-biased base composition (58. 4%) , and a coding reassignment of UGA Stop-Trp. Although it is not clear why this tiny genome lacks the low GC content typical of other small bacterial genomes, these observations support a role of genome reduction rather than base composition as a driver of codon reassignment.","The genetic code, which relates DNA sequence to protein sequence, is nearly universal across all life. Examples of recodings do exist, but new instances are rare. Genomes that exhibit recodings typically have other extreme properties, including reduced size, reduced gene sets, and low guanine plus cytosine ( GC) content. The most common recoding event, the reassignment of UGA to Tryptophan instead of Stop ( Stop-Trp) , was previously known from several mitochondrial and one bacterial lineage, and it was proposed to be driven by extinction of the UGA codon due to reduction in GC content. Here we present an unusual bacterial genome from a symbiont of cicadas. It exhibits the UGA Stop-Trp reassignment, but has a high GC content, showing that reduction in GC content is not a necessary condition for this recoding. This symbiont genome is also the smallest known for any cellular organism. We therefore propose gene loss during genome reduction as the common force driving this code change in bacteria and organelles. Additionally, the extremely small size of the genome further obscures the once-clear distinction between organelle and autonomous bacterial life.","we show that an a-Proteobacterial symbiont of cicadas has the unprecedented combination of an extremely small genome (144 kb) , a GC-biased base composition (58. 4%) , and an coding reassignment of UGA Stop to Tryptophan (Stop-Trp) . a combination of genome sequencing and high-throughput proteomics has been proposed to drive the recoding of a small bacterial genome . we demonstrate that a large bacterial cyclocycline ( guanine plus cytosine (GC) content is a driver of codon "
"In bacterial genomes composed of more than one chromosome, one replicon is typically larger, harbors more essential genes than the others, and is considered primary. The greater variability of secondary chromosomes among related taxa has led to the theory that they serve as an accessory genome for specific niches or conditions. By this rationale, purifying selection should be weaker on genes on secondary chromosomes because of their reduced necessity or usage. To test this hypothesis we selected bacterial genomes composed of multiple chromosomes from two genera, Burkholderia and Vibrio, and quantified the evolutionary rates (dN and dS) of all orthologs within each genus. Both evolutionary rate parameters were faster among orthologs found on secondary chromosomes than those on the primary chromosome. Further, in every bacterial genome with multiple chromosomes that we studied, genes on secondary chromosomes exhibited significantly weaker codon usage bias than those on primary chromosomes. Faster evolution and reduced codon bias could in turn result from global effects of chromosome position, as genes on secondary chromosomes experience reduced dosage and expression due to their delayed replication, or selection on specific gene attributes. These alternatives were evaluated using orthologs common to genomes with multiple chromosomes and genomes with single chromosomes. Analysis of these ortholog sets suggested that inherently fast-evolving genes tend to be sorted to secondary chromosomes when they arise; however, prolonged evolution on a secondary chromosome further accelerated substitution rates. In summary, secondary chromosomes in bacteria are evolutionary test beds where genes are weakly preserved and evolve more rapidly, likely because they are used less frequently.","Why many bacteria have multiple chromosomes is largely unknown, but a leading hypothesis is that secondary chromosomes evolved from plasmids and now serve as accessory genomes. We tested a key prediction of this theory that genes on secondary chromosomes should evolve faster because they are under less selective constraint. Indeed, orthologous genes shared within two groups of bacteria ( Burkholderia or Vibrio) with multiple chromosomes were less conserved and evolved more rapidly when found on secondary chromosomes. Much of these patterns could stem from the tendency of secondary chromosomes to be replicated later in the cell cycle, which reduces their gene dosage, their potential for expression, and selection for their optimal translation. However, the content of secondary chromosomes appears to be predisposed to evolve faster, because these same genes still evolve more rapidly in single-chromosome genomes. In summary, the evolution of divided genomes therefore appears to allow for the long-term segregation of genome content by their rates of expression and dispensability, placing some genes at increased risk of mutational decay and greater turnover.","background : in bacterial genomes composed of more than one chromosome, one replicon is typically larger and harbors more essential genes than the others , and is considered primary . to test this hypothesis we selected bacterial genomics of multiple chromoomes from two genera, Burkholderia and Vibrio . we quantified the evolutionary rates (dN and dS) of all orthologs within each genus . further , in every bacter genome with multiple x - rays that we studied , genes on secondary chromes exhibited significantly weaker codon usage bias than those on the primary , as genes on"
"Anthrax toxin is an intracellularly acting toxin in which sufficient information is available regarding the structure of its transmembrane channel, allowing for detailed investigation of models of translocation. Anthrax toxin, comprising three proteins--protective antigen (PA) , lethal factor (LF) , and edema factor--translocates large proteins across membranes. Here we show that the PA translocase channel has a transport function in which its catalytic active sites operate allosterically. We find that the phenylalanine clamp (ph-clamp) , the known conductance bottleneck in the PA translocase, gates as either a more closed state or a more dilated state. Thermodynamically, the two channel states have >300-fold different binding affinities for an LF-derived peptide. The change in clamp thermodynamics requires distant a-clamp and ph-clamp sites. Clamp allostery and translocation are more optimal for LF peptides with uniform stereochemistry, where the least allosteric and least efficiently translocated peptide had a mixed stereochemistry. Overall, the kinetic results are in less agreement with an extended-chain Brownian ratchet model but, instead, are more consistent with an allosteric helix-compression model that is dependent also on substrate peptide coil-to-helix/helix-to-coil cooperativity.","Significance High-resolution structural information on anthrax toxin allows for elucidation of detailed molecular models of transmembrane translocation. The toxin's translocase channel component, protective antigen ( PA) , utilizes a series of polypeptide clamp sites, which serve as binding sites. It is not known how these clamps catalyze the translocation of large proteins while avoiding kinetic traps in which the translocated protein would remain tightly bound inside the channel. Here the clamp sites in PA are revealed to operate allosterically, allowing for the coordination of their activities and the avoidance of kinetic traps that would impede translocation.

"Master splicing regulator MBNL1 shapes large transcriptomic changes that drive cellular differentiation during development. Here we demonstrate that MBNL1 is a suppressor of tumor dedifferentiation. We surveyed MBNL1 expression in matched tumor/normal pairs across The Cancer Genome Atlas and found that MBNL1 was down-regulated in several common cancers. Down-regulation of MBNL1 predicted poor overall survival in breast, lung, and stomach adenocarcinomas and increased relapse and distant metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer. Down-regulation of MBNL1 led to increased tumorigenic and stem/progenitor-like properties in vitro and in vivo. A discrete set of alternative splicing events (ASEs) are shared between MBNL1-low cancers and embryonic stem cells including a MAP2K7exon2 splice variant that leads to increased stem/progenitor-like properties via JNK activation.

"HIV-1 maturation occurs via multiple proteolytic cleavages of the Gag polyprotein, causing rearrangement of the virus particle required for infectivity. Cleavage results in beta-hairpin formation at the N terminus of the CA (capsid) protein and loss of a six-helix bundle formed by the C terminus of CA and the neighboring SP1 peptide. How individual cleavages contribute to changes in protein structure and interactions, and how the mature, conical capsid forms, are poorly understood. Here, we employed cryoelectron tomography to determine morphology and high-resolution CA lattice structures for HIV-1 derivatives in which Gag cleavage sites are mutated. These analyses prompt us to revise current models for the crucial maturation switch. Unlike previously proposed, cleavage on either terminus of CA was sufficient, in principle, for lattice maturation, while complete processing was needed for conical capsid formation. We conclude that destabilization of the six-helix bundle, rather than beta-hairpin formation, represents the main determinant of structural maturation.","Significance The main structural component of HIV-1 is the Gag polyprotein. During virus release, Gag is cleaved by the viral protease at five sites, triggering a major change in the structure and morphology of the virus. This transition, called maturation, is required to make an infectious virion. We used cryoelectron tomography to obtain high-resolution structures of Gag inside virus particles carrying mutations that block specific combinations of cleavage sites. Analysis of these structures suggests that different combinations of cleavages can destabilize a bundle of alpha-helices at the C terminus of CA. This destabilization, rather than formation of a beta-hairpin at the N terminus of CA as previously suggested, acts as the structural switch for maturation of the virus into its infectious form.","HIV-1 maturation occurs via multiple proteolytic cleavages of the Gag polyprotein , causing rearrangement of the virus particle required for infectivity . we used cryoelectron tomography to determine morphology and high-resolution CA lattice structures for HIV-1 derivatives in which Gag cleaves are mutated . this analysis prompts us to revise current models for the crucial maturation switch ."
"Malaria continues to impose a significant health burden in the continent of Africa with 213 million cases in 2018 alone, representing 93% of cases worldwide. Because of high transmission of malaria within the continent, the selection pressures to develop drug resistance in African parasites are distinct compared to the rest of the world. In light of the spread of resistance to artemisinin conferred by the C580Y mutation in the PfKelch13 propeller domain in Southeast Asia, and its independent emergence in South America, it is important to study genetic determinants of resistance in the African context using African parasites. Through in vitro evolution of Senegalese parasites, we had previously generated the artemisinin-resistant parasites Pikine_R and Thies_R and established pfcoronin mutations to be sufficient to confer artemisinin resistance in the standard ring-stage survival assay (RSA) . In the current study, we used genetic analysis of revertants to demonstrate pfcoronin to be the major driver of elevated RSA in the artemisinin-resistant parasites Pikine_R and Thies_R evolved in vitro. We interrogated the role of a second gene PF3D7_1433800, which also had mutations in both the Pikine_R and Thies_R selected lines, but found no evidence of a contribution to reduced susceptibility in the RSA survival assay. Nevertheless, our genetic analysis demonstrates that parasite genetic background is important in the level of pfcoronin mediated RSA survival, and therefore we cannot rule out a role for PF3D7_1433800 in other genetic backgrounds. Finally, we tested the potential synergy between the mutations of pfcoronin and pfkelch13 through the generation of single and double mutants in the Pikine genetic background and found that the contribution of pfcoronin to reduced susceptibility is masked by the presence of pfkelch13. This phenomenon was also observed in the 3D7 background, suggesting that pfcoronin may mediate its effects via the same pathway as pfkelch13. Investigating the biology of proteins containing the beta-propeller domain could further elucidate the different pathways that the parasite could use to attain resistance.","Artemisinin-based combination therapies remain a crucial standard treatment in combatting malaria around the world. Given the independent emergence of artemisinin resistance associated with pfkelch13 mutations in Southeast Asia and South America, it is important to study genetic determinants in the African context. Previously, we had generated artemisinin-resistant parasites, referred to as Pikine_R and Thies_R, by subjecting clinical isolates of parasites from Senegal to artemisinin drug pressure in the laboratory. We found that mutations in the pfcoronin gene are sufficient to result in resistance in a standard laboratory assay. Here we report that pfcoronin mutations are also necessary for the level of artemisinin resistance observed in both Pikine_R and Thies_R. In diverse parasite strains the level of resistance is also sensitive to genetic background. Genetic analysis revealed that the resistance phenotype of pfkelch13 alone masks any additional contribution from pfcoronin. Future studies should focus on investigating pfcoronin biology.","background : malaria continues to impose a significant health burden in the continent of Africa with 213 million cases in 2018 alone , representing 93% of cases worldwide . in light of the spread of resistance to artemisinin conferred by the C580Y mutation in the PfKelch13 propeller domain in Southeast Asia, and its independent emergence in South America, it is important to study genetic determinants of resistance in the African context using African parasites.materials and methods : we used genetic analysis of revertants to demonstrate pfcoronin to be the major driver of elevated RSA in the standard ring-stage survival assay (RSA) "
"Gametes are the source and carrier of genetic information, essential for the propagation of all sexually reproducing organisms. Male gametes are derived from a progenitor stem cell population called spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) . SSCs give rise to male gametes through the coordination of two essential processes: self-renewal to produce more SSCs, and differentiation to produce mature sperm. Disruption of this equilibrium can lead to excessive proliferation of SSCs, causing tumorigenesis, or can result in aberrant differentiation, leading to infertility. Little is known about how SSCs achieve the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation, which is necessary for their remarkable output and developmental potential. To understand the mechanisms of SSC maintenance, we examine the planarian homolog of Nuclear Factor Y-B (NF-YB) , which is required for the maintenance of early planarian male germ cells. Here, we demonstrate that NF-YB plays a role in the self-renewal and proliferation of planarian SSCs, but not in their specification or differentiation. Furthermore, we characterize members of the NF-Y complex in Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm related to the free-living planarian. We find that the function of NF-YB in regulating male germ cell proliferation is conserved in schistosomes. This finding is especially significant because fecundity is the cause of pathogenesis of S. mansoni. Our findings can help elucidate the complex relationship between self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs, and may also have implications for understanding and controlling schistosomiasis.","Sexually reproducing organisms require gametes-sperm and eggs-for the perpetuation of life and transmission of genetic information between generations. Male gametes ( sperm) arise from a dedicated population of stem cells known as spermatogonial stem cells ( SSCs) .

Here we show that a male germ cell-specific homolog of the ubiquitous Nuclear Factor-Y family of transcription factors, NF-YB, is required for the self-renewal and proliferation of SSCs in the freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea. Additionally, we extend our study to the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of the major neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis and evolutionary cousin of the free-living planarian. We find that there is a loss of proliferating cells in the testes of the parasite when schistosome NF-Y components are inhibited. This observation is significant since the reproductive output of S. mansoni is the primary cause of the morbidity associated with schistosomiasis. Together, our results establish NF-YB as an important regulator of SSC maintenance, and may open avenues for combating schistosomiasis.","the planarian homolog of nuclear factor Y-B (NF-YB ) plays a role in the self-renewal and proliferation of planarian male germ cells , but not in their specification or differentiation . to understand the mechanisms of SSC maintenance , we examine a planarian heterolog of Nuclear Factor y-B , a parasitic flatworm related to the free-living planarian . this finding is especially significant because fecundity is the cause of pathogenesis of spermatogonial stem cells ( SSCs) . we find that the function of NF-yB in regulating male germ cell proliferation is conserved"
"Most population genetic theories on the evolution of sex or recombination are based on fairly restrictive assumptions about the nature of the underlying fitness landscapes. Here we use computer simulations to study the evolution of sex on fitness landscapes with different degrees of complexity and epistasis. We evaluate predictors of the evolution of sex, which are derived from the conditions established in the population genetic literature for the evolution of sex on simpler fitness landscapes. These predictors are based on quantities such as the variance of Hamming distance, mean fitness, additive genetic variance, and epistasis. We show that for complex fitness landscapes all the predictors generally perform poorly. Interestingly, while the simplest predictor, DVarHD, also suffers from a lack of accuracy, it turns out to be the most robust across different types of fitness landscapes. DVarHD is based on the change in Hamming distance variance induced by recombination and thus does not require individual fitness measurements. The presence of loci that are not under selection can, however, severely diminish predictor accuracy. Our study thus highlights the difficulty of establishing reliable criteria for the evolution of sex on complex fitness landscapes and illustrates the challenge for both theoretical and experimental research on the origin and maintenance of sexual reproduction.","One of the biggest open questions in evolutionary biology is why sexual reproduction is so common despite its manifold costs. Many hypotheses have been proposed that can potentially explain the emergence and maintenance of sexual reproduction in nature, and currently the biggest challenge in the field is assessing their plausibility. Theoretical work has identified the conditions under which sexual reproduction is expected. However, these conditions were typically derived, making strongly simplifying assumptions about the relationship between organisms' genotype and fitness, known as the fitness landscape. Building onto previous theoretical work, we here propose different population properties that can be used to predict when sex will be beneficial. We then use simulations across a range of simple and complex fitness landscapes to test if such predictors generate accurate predictions of evolutionary outcomes. We find that one of the simplest predictors, related to variation of genetic distance between sequences, is also the most accurate one across our simulations. However, stochastic effects occurring in small populations compromise the accuracy of all predictors. Our study both illustrates the limitations of various predictors and suggests directions in which to search for new, experimentally attainable predictors.",background : most population genetic theories on the evolution of sex or recombination are based on fairly restrictive assumptions about the nature of the underlying fitness landscapes . here we use computer simulations to study the evolution and characterization of predictors derived from the conditions established in the population genetic literature for the evolution . this study highlights the difficulty of establishing reliable criteria for evolution and illustrates the challenge for both theoretical and experimental research on the origin and maintenance of sexual reproduction.materials and methods : this study was conducted using a computer simulation to evaluate predictor of the development of a plain language summary that is easy to read highlighting key points and removing unnecessary details that can be

A typical hand muscle spans over 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) , wrapping over complex geometrical constraints that change its moment arms and lead to complex posture-dependent variation in torque generation. Here, we report a method to accurately and efficiently calculate musculotendon length and moment arms across all physiological postures of the forearm muscles that actuate the hand and wrist. Then, we use this model to test the hypothesis that the functional similarities of muscle actions are embedded in muscle structure. The posture dependent muscle geometry, moment arms and lengths of modeled muscles were captured using autogenerating polynomials that expanded their optimal selection of terms using information measurements. The iterative process approximated 33 musculotendon actuators, each spanning up to 6 DOFs in an 18 DOF model of the human arm and hand, defined over the full physiological range of motion. Using these polynomials, the entire forearm anatomy could be computed in <10 ms, which is far better than what is required for real-time performance, and with low errors in moment arms (below 5%) and lengths (below 0. 4%) . Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of elements in these autogenerating polynomials does not increase exponentially with increasing muscle complexity; complexity increases linearly instead. Dimensionality reduction using the polynomial terms alone resulted in clusters comprised of muscles with similar functions, indicating the high accuracy of approximating models. We propose that this novel method of describing musculoskeletal biomechanics might further improve the applications of detailed and scalable models to describe human movement.","The community in the fields of biomechanics, neural engineering, and neuroscience has the need to understand and simulate realistic muscle actions in real-time. In biomechanics, the models of muscle structure have been of paramount importance for understanding the mechanical demands of movements. In neural engineering, the use of biomimetic control schemes require realistic and real-time computations with low latencies to achieve an intuitive interface with high-dimensional active prostheses or orthoses. In neuroscience, the new realization of the close relationship between neural computations and body mechanics has been promoted under the concept of neuromechanics. This concept has been instrumental in the understanding of neural computations for movement planning and execution. To enable the theoretical framework of neuromechanical computations embedded within musculoskeletal organization we propose a novel method for calculating muscle biomechanics in real-time with objective approximations that embed structural and functional attributes of simulated muscles. This description offers a scalable solution that accurately computes muscle kinematic states with real-time latencies surpassing the previous results by an order of magnitude.","we report a method to accurately and efficiently calculate musculotendon length and moment arms across all physiological postures of the forearm muscles that actuate the hand and wrist . the posture dependent muscle geometry , moment arms and lengths of modeled muscles were captured using autogenerating polynomials that expanded their optimal selection of terms using information measurements . this method was used to test the hypothesis that the functional similarities of muscle actions are embedded in muscle structure . a typical hand muscle spans over 3 degrees of freedom , wrapping over complex geometrical constraints that change its moment arms , lead to complex posture-dependent variation in torque generation . we propose that this novel method of describing "
"Although osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare cancer, it is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. BRCAness is a phenotypical trait in tumors with a defect in homologous recombination repair, resembling tumors with inactivation of BRCA1/2, rendering these tumors sensitive to poly (ADP) -ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) . Recently, OS was shown to exhibit molecular features of BRCAness. Our goal was to develop a method complementing existing genomic methods to aid clinical decision making on administering PARPi in OS patients. OS samples with DNA-methylation data were divided to BRCAness-positive and negative groups based on the degree of their genomic instability (n = 41) . Methylation probes were ranked according to decreasing variance difference between two groups. The top 2000 probes were selected for training and cross-validation of the random forest algorithm. Two-thirds of available OS RNA-Seq samples (n = 17) from the top and bottom of the sample list ranked according to genome instability score were subjected to differential expression and, subsequently, to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) . The combined accuracy of trained random forest was 85% and the average area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0. 95. There were 449 upregulated and 1, 079 downregulated genes in the BRCAness-positive group (fdr < 0. 05) . GSEA of upregulated genes detected enrichment of DNA replication and mismatch repair and homologous recombination signatures (FWER < 0. 05) . Validation of the BRCAness classifier with an independent OS set (n = 20) collected later in the course of study showed AUC of 0. 87 with an accuracy of 90%. GSEA signatures computed for this test set were matching the ones observed in the training set enrichment analysis. In conclusion, we developed a new classifier based on DNA-methylation patterns that detects BRCAness in OS samples with high accuracy. GSEA identified genome instability signatures. Machine-learning and gene expression approaches add new epigenomic and transcriptomic aspects to already established genomic methods for evaluation of BRCAness in osteosarcoma and can be extended to cancers characterized by genome instability.","Osteosarcoma ( OS) is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone in children and young adults with poor prognosis for patients with refractory or metastatic disease. A common feature, so-called BRCAness, exists in multiple cancers including OS and is characterized by homologous recombination deficiency. Tumors exhibiting BRCAness have been shown to respond to therapy with PARP inhibitors. Currently, BRCAness is mostly assessed by the genomic instability score. This method based on the DNA sequencing requires normal tissue DNA as control and is vulnerable to subjective interpretation of ""genomic scarring"" events. In this study, we implemented a classifier based on DNA methylation patterns. It is capable of detecting BRCAness in OS samples and does not require control tissue DNA. Therefore, it has the potential to support clinical decision making on administering PARPi in OS patients. We further corroborated the presence of BRCAness in OS by detecting homologous recombination signatures through gene expression analysis.","osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare cancer , but it is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents . we developed a new classifier based on DNA-methylation patterns that detects BRCAness in OS samples with high accuracy . genome instability signatures were analyzed using a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA ) algorithm . a total of 449 upregulated and 1, 079 downregulated genes were detected in the bRCAness-positive group (fdr  0. 05) from the top and bottom of the sample list ranked according to genome instability score were subjected to differential expression and, subsequently, to"
"To what extent does the dynamical mechanism producing a specific biological phenotype bias the ability to evolve into novel phenotypes? We use the interpretation of a morphogen gradient into a single stripe of gene expression as a model phenotype. Although there are thousands of three-gene circuit topologies that can robustly develop a stripe of gene expression, the vast majority of these circuits use one of just six fundamentally different dynamical mechanisms. Here we explore the potential for gene circuits that use each of these six mechanisms to evolve novel phenotypes such as multiple stripes, inverted stripes, and gradients of gene expression. Through a comprehensive and systematic analysis, we find that circuits that use alternative mechanisms differ in the likelihood of reaching novel phenotypes through mutation. We characterize the phenotypic transitions and identify key ingredients of the evolutionary potential, such as sensitive interactions and phenotypic hubs. Finally, we provide an intuitive understanding on how the modular design of a particular mechanism favors the access to novel phenotypes. Our work illustrates how the dynamical mechanism by which an organism develops constrains how it can evolve. It is striking that these dynamical mechanisms and their impact on evolvability can be observed even for such an apparently simple patterning task, performed by just three-node circuits.","Significance It is widely accepted that the structure of a biological system limits the range of possible novel phenotypes accessible by mutation. Here we show that it is not only the phenotype that determines this evolvability, but also the dynamics of how that phenotype is built during development. We perform theoretical analysis on a group of simple gene regulatory circuits that have recently been shown to fall into a handful of distinct dynamical mechanisms all producing the same phenotype: interpreting a morphogen gradient into a single-domain of gene expression. We find that the dynamical mechanisms underlying each circuit impose strong constraints on its evolvability, as hypothesized in a more general context by John Maynard Smith in the 1980s.","we explore the potential for gene circuits that use each of these six mechanisms to evolve novel phenotypes such as multiple stripes, inverted stripes, and gradients of gene expression . through a comprehensive and systematic analysis, we find that circuits which use alternative mechanisms differ in the likelihood of reaching novel p  0.05 through mutation . we identify key ingredients of the evolutionary potential , such as sensitive interactions and phen typic hubs , and provide an intuitive understanding on how the modular design of a particular mechanism favors the access to novel genes : multiple stripes , morphogen gradients, and evolvability can be observed even for such an apparently simple patterning"
"Neurotransmitter release is governed by eight central proteins among other factors: the neuronal SNAREs syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25, which form a tight SNARE complex that brings the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes together; NSF and SNAPs, which disassemble SNARE complexes; Munc18-1 and Munc13-1, which organize SNARE complex assembly; and the Ca^2+ sensor synaptotagmin-1. Reconstitution experiments revealed that Munc18-1, Munc13-1, NSF, and a-SNAP can mediate Ca^2+-dependent liposome fusion between synaptobrevin liposomes and syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 liposomes, but high fusion efficiency due to uncontrolled SNARE complex assembly did not allow investigation of the role of synaptotagmin-1 on fusion. Here, we show that decreasing the synaptobrevin-to-lipid ratio in the corresponding liposomes to very low levels leads to inefficient fusion and that synaptotagmin-1 strongly stimulates fusion under these conditions. Such stimulation depends on Ca^2+ binding to the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin-1. We also show that anchoring SNAP-25 on the syntaxin-1 liposomes dramatically enhances fusion. Moreover, we uncover a synergy between synaptotagmin-1 and membrane anchoring of SNAP-25, which allows efficient Ca^2+-dependent fusion between liposomes bearing very low synaptobrevin densities and liposomes containing very low syntaxin-1 densities. Thus, liposome fusion in our assays is achieved with a few SNARE complexes in a manner that requires Munc18-1 and Munc13-1 and that depends on Ca^2+ binding to synaptotagmin-1, all of which are fundamental features of neurotransmitter release in neurons.","Significance Neurotransmitter release is crucial for neuronal communication. Reproducing the steps that lead to neuronal exocytosis with lipid vesicles and purified proteins provides a powerful strategy to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying release. Previous studies showed that reconstitution experiments including Munc18-1, Munc13-1, NSF, a-SNAP, and the SNARE proteins synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1, and SNAP-25, all of which are critical for neurotransmitter release, led to highly efficient vesicle fusion. However, synaptotagmin-1, the Ca^2+ sensor that triggers release, did not have detectable effects in these fusion assays. We now show that, when the amounts of synaptobrevin and syntaxin-1 are lowered in otherwise analogous reconstitution experiments, vesicle fusion is strongly dependent on synaptotagmin-1, exhibiting several features that parallel those of neurotransmitter release in neurons.","neurotransmitter release is governed by eight central proteins among other factors : the neuronal SNAREs syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25 , which form a tight SNare complex that brings the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes together ; NSF and snass ; which disassemble SNa complexes; Munc18-1 and Munc13-1 ; and the a-SNAP can mediate ca2+-dependent liposome fusion under these conditions . here, we show that decreasing the fusion efficiency due to uncontrolled synaptotag"
"Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) maturation of an immunoglobulin (Ig) powered by supercomputation delivers novel functionality to this catalytic template and facilitates artificial evolution of biocatalysts. We here employ density functional theory-based (DFT-b) tight binding and funnel metadynamics to advance our earlier QM/MM maturation of A17 Ig-paraoxonase (WTIgP) as a reactibody for organophosphorus toxins. It enables regulation of biocatalytic activity for tyrosine nucleophilic attack on phosphorus. The single amino acid substitution l-Leu47Lys results in 340-fold enhanced reactivity for paraoxon. The computed ground-state complex shows substrate-induced ionization of the nucleophilic l-Tyr37, now H-bonded to l-Lys47, resulting from repositioning of l-Lys47. Multiple antibody structural homologs, selected by phenylphosphonate covalent capture, show contrasting enantioselectivities for a P-chiral phenylphosphonate toxin. That is defined by crystallographic analysis of phenylphosphonylated reaction products for antibodies A5 and WTIgP. DFT-b analysis using QM regions based on these structures identifies transition states for the favored and disfavored reactions with surprising results. This stereoselection analysis is extended by funnel metadynamics to a range of WTIgP variants whose predicted stereoselectivity is endorsed by experimental analysis. The algorithms used here offer prospects for tailored design of highly evolved, genetically encoded organophosphorus scavengers and for broader functionalities of members of the Ig superfamily, including cell surface-exposed receptors.","Significance Developed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics ( QM/MM) supercomputation is used to identify maturation of immunoglobulin ( Ig) reactivity through optimization of amino acids in the catalytic core, focused on enhanced nucleophilic attack on phosphorus.

Variant antibody stereoselectivity toward a P-chiral phenylphosphonate toxin results from starkly contrasting solvent-assisted or general base catalytic mechanisms relative to the parent Ig-paraoxonase.

"Efficient electron transfer between a cathode and an active organic layer is one key to realizing high-performance organic devices, which require electron injection/transport materials with very low work functions. We developed two wide-bandgap amorphous (a-) oxide semiconductors, a-calcium aluminate electride (a-C12A7: e) and a-zinc silicate (a-ZSO) . A-ZSO exhibits a low work function of 3. 5 eV and high electron mobility of 1 cm^2/(V * s) ; furthermore, it also forms an ohmic contact with not only conventional cathode materials but also anode materials. A-C12A7: e has an exceptionally low work function of 3. 0 eV and is used to enhance the electron injection property from a-ZSO to an emission layer. The inverted electron-only and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices fabricated with these two materials exhibit excellent performance compared with the normal type with LiF/Al. This approach provides a solution to the problem of fabricating oxide thin-film transistor-driven OLEDs with both large size and high stability.","Significance Organic electronics have vast potential due to the huge space for molecular design and the soft nature of organics.

"Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is associated with improved outcomes for people with various hematologic diseases; however, the morbidity and mortality resulting from acute and subsequently chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) pose a serious challenge to wider applicability of allo-HCT. Intravenous methotrexate in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine or tacrolimus, is a widely used regimen for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD, but the administration of methotrexate is associated with a number of adverse events. Mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor, has been used extensively in people undergoing allo-HCT. Conflicting results regarding various clinical outcomes following allo-HCT have been observed when comparing mycophenolate mofetil-based regimens against methotrexate-based regimens for acute GVHD prophylaxis. Objectives Primary objective: to assess the effect of mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for prevention of acute GVHD in people undergoing allo-HCT. Secondary objectives: to evaluate the effect of mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for overall survival, prevention of chronic GVHD, incidence of relapse, treatment-related harms, nonrelapse mortality, and quality of life. Search methods We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE from inception to March 2014. We handsearched conference abstracts from the last two meetings (2011 and 2012) of relevant societies in the field. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, Novartis clinical trials database Roche clinical trial protocol registry Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for ongoing trials. Selection criteria Two review authors independently reviewed all titles/abstracts and selected full-text articles for inclusion. We included all references that reported results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for the prophylaxis of GVHD among people undergoing allo-HCT in this review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data on outcomes from all studies and compared prior to data entry and analysis. We expressed results as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for time-to-event outcomes. We pooled the individual study effects using the random-effects model. Estimates lower than one indicate that mycophenolate mofetil was favored over methotrexate. Main results We included three trials enrolling 177 participants (174 participants analyzed). All participants in the trials by Keihl et al. and Bolwell et al. received cyclosporine while all participants enrolled in the trial by Perkins et al. received tacrolimus. However, the results did not differ by the type of calcineurin inhibitor employed (cyclosporine versus tacrolimus). There was no evidence for a difference between mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for the outcomes of incidence of acute GVHD (RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.75 to 2.09; P value = 0.39, very low quality evidence), overall survival (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.17; P value = 0.19, low-quality evidence), median days to neutrophil engraftment (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.17; P value = 0.23, low-quality evidence), incidence of relapse (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; P value = 0.50, low-quality evidence), non-relapse mortality (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.36; P value = 0.57, low-quality evidence), and incidence of chronic GVHD (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.30; P value = 0.62, low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence that mycophenolate mofetil compared with methotrexate improved platelet engraftment period (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.93; P value < 0.0001, low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence that mycophenolate mofetil compared with methotrexate resulted in decreased incidence of severe mucositis (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.73; P value = 0.0006, low-quality evidence), use of parenteral nutrition (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.91; P value = 0.02, low-quality evidence), and medication for pain control (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; P value = 0.002, low-quality evidence). Overall heterogeneity was not detected in the analysis except for the outcome of neutrophil engraftment. None of the included studies reported any outcomes related to quality of life. Overall quality of evidence was low. Authors' conclusions The use of mycophenolate mofetil compared with methotrexate for primary prevention of GVHD seems to be associated with a more favorable toxicity profile, without an apparent compromise on disease relapse, transplant-associated mortality, or overall survival. The effects on incidence of GVHD between people receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared with people receiving methotrexate were uncertain. There is a need for additional high-quality RCTs to determine the optimal GVHD prevention strategy. Future studies should take into account a comprehensive view of clinical benefit, including measures of morbidity, symptom burden, and healthcare resource utilization associated with interventions.","Mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for prevention of graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a procedure in which a portion of a healthy donor's stem cells (cells that can develop into various types of blood cells) or bone marrow is obtained and prepared for intravenous infusion. Hematopoietic stem cells are taken from a healthy donor and transplanted into the patient (recipient). People undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are at risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD results when the transplanted cells from the donor (graft) attack the recipient's (host) body cells because they perceive the recipient's body as foreign. Mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate are two drugs often used to suppress the human body's reaction against the graft (immune response) and prevent GVHD. We conducted a systematic review of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs, which are clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for use in preventing GVHD among 174 participants. We searched for the relevant studies in March 2014. Study characteristics All participants in these RCTs received a drug aimed at suppressing the immune response (cyclosporine or tacrolimus). The study by Perkins and coworkers was funded by public and industry sources. The study by Kiehl and coworkers was funded by public sources. The funding source for the study by Bolwell and coworkers was not specified. Key results Our results show no clinically meaningful difference between mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate on length of survival, incidence of GVHD, disease relapse, or treatment-related death. People treated with mycophenolate mofetil had a shorter time to make new platelets (cells that help the blood to clot) from the donor cells compared with people treated with methotrexate. In addition, in terms of side effects, people treated with mycophenolate mofetil were less likely to have severe mucositis (inflammation of the mucus membranes), require parenteral nutrition (feeding through a vein), or pain medication. None of the included studies reported any data related to quality of life. In summary, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate both remain acceptable medications for the prevention of GVHD; however, mycophenolate mofetil seems to be associated with a smaller incidence of harms such as severe mucositis and related supportive care. Quality of evidence The overall quality of evidence was low.","background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HCT) is associated with improved outcomes for people with various hematologic diseases ; however, the morbidity and mortality resulting from acute and subsequently chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD) pose a serious challenge to wider applicability of allo - HCT . conflicting results regarding various clinical outcomes following the administration of methotrexate have been observed when comparing mycophenolate mofetil-based regimens against cyclosporine or tacrolimus.objectives:to assess the effect of mycophenyl versus met"
"Colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori is an important risk factor for development of gastric cancer. The H. pylori cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) encodes components of a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells, and CagL is a specialized component of the cag T4SS that binds the host receptor a5b1 integrin. Here, we utilized a mass spectrometry-based approach to reveal co-purification of CagL, CagI (another integrin-binding protein) , and CagH (a protein with weak sequence similarity to CagL) . These three proteins are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PAI, and are detectable on the bacterial surface. All three proteins are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells; however, these proteins are not homologous to components of T4SSs in other bacterial species. Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that these proteins are involved in the formation of pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. DcagI and DcagL mutant strains fail to form pili, whereas a DcagH mutant strain exhibits a hyperpiliated phenotype and produces pili that are elongated and thickened compared to those of the wild-type strain. This suggests that pilus dimensions are regulated by CagH. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif is present in CagH, CagI, and CagL. Deletion of these motifs results in abrogation of CagA translocation and IL-8 induction, and the C-terminal motifs of CagI and CagL are required for formation of pili. In summary, these results indicate that CagH, CagI, and CagL are components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis, and highlight the important role played by unique constituents of the H. pylori cag T4SS.","Helicobacter pylori persistently colonizes the stomach in approximately half of the human population. People who are infected with H. pylori strains harboring the cag pathogenicity island ( PAI) have an increased risk of developing gastric cancer. The cag PAI encodes a type IV secretion system ( T4SS) that is utilized by the bacteria to inject the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. Related T4SSs found in several other bacteria have been studied in detail, but thus far there has been very little study of the H. pylori cag T4SS. Here, we utilized a mass spectrometry-based approach to reveal co-purification of three constituents of the H. pylori T4SS ( CagH, CagI, and CagL) that lack homology to components of T4SSs in other bacterial species.

"The global burden of diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In montane areas of South-East Asia such as northern Laos, recent changes in land use have induced increased runoff, soil erosion and in-stream suspended sediment loads, and potential pathogen dissemination. To our knowledge, few studies have related diarrhea incidences to catchment scale hydrological factors such as river discharge, and loads of suspended sediment and of Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) such as Escherichia coli, together with sociological factors such as hygiene practices. We hypothesized that climate factors combined with human behavior control diarrhea incidence, either because higher rainfall, leading to higher stream discharges, suspended sediment loads and FIB counts, are associated with higher numbers of reported diarrhea cases during the rainy season, or because water shortage leads to the use of less safe water sources during the dry season. Using E. coli as a FIB, the objectives of this study were thus (1) to characterize the epidemiological dynamics of diarrhea in Northern Laos, and (2) to identify which hydro-meteorological and sociological risk factors were associated with diarrhea epidemics. Considering two unconnected river catchments of 22 and 7, 448 km2, respectively, we conducted a retrospective time series analysis of meteorological variables (rainfall, air temperature) , hydrological variables (discharge, suspended sediments, FIB counts, water temperature) , and the number of diarrheal disease cases reported at 6 health centers located in the 5 southern districts of the Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR. We also examined the socio-demographic factors potentially affecting vulnerability to the effect of the climate factors, such as drinking water sources, hygiene habits, and recreational water exposure. Using thus a mixed methods approach, we found E. coli to be present all year long (100-1, 000 Most Probable Number or MPN 100 mL-1) indicating that fecal contamination is ubiquitous and constant. We found that populations switch their water supply from wells to surface water during drought periods, the latter of which appear to be at higher risk of bacterial contamination than municipal water fountains. We thus found that water shortage in the Luang Prabang area triggers diarrhea peaks during the dry and hot season and that rainfall and aquifer refill ends the epidemic during the wet season. The temporal trends of reported daily diarrhea cases were generally bimodal with hospital admissions peaking in February-March and later in May-July. Annual incidence rates were higher in more densely populated areas and mostly concerned the 0-4 age group and male patients. We found that anthropogenic drivers, such as hygiene practices, were at least as important as environmental drivers in determining the seasonal pattern of a diarrhea epidemic. For diarrheal disease risk monitoring, discharge or groundwater level can be considered as relevant proxies. These variables should be monitored in the framework of an early warning system provided that a tradeoff is found between the size of the monitored catchment and the frequency of the measurement.","Aiming to identify the most critical drivers of diarrhea epidemics in montane areas of South-East Asia, we conducted a retrospective time series analysis of diarrhea reported cases and of hydro-meteorological variables measured in two contrasted river basins in northern Laos, together with socio-behavioral practices. We found that during drought periods, the population switches its water supply from wells to surface water where we measured numbers of fecal indicator bacteria ( E. coli) of 100-1, 000 MPN 100 mL-1 ( the World Health Organization recommendation is 0 MPN 100 mL-1 in drinking water supply sources) . We found that water shortages trigger diarrhea peaks during the dry and hot seasons and that rainfall and subsequent aquifer refill ends the epidemic during the wet season. As E. coli counts in surface water are high all year long, E. coli may not be a relevant indicator of the fecal risk in this area. Conversely, stream discharge and aquifer water level appear to be relevant proxies to predict diarrheal risk. Mitigating both environmental and anthropogenic drivers of fecal bacteria dissemination in developing countries is critical in the context of global change: more intense rainfall combined to the extension of run-off prone land uses ( e. g. tree plantation without understorey) may decrease both the aquifer recharge and the contaminant retention ecosystem service, and thus threaten the availability of safe water resource for the population.","background : the global burden of diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide . recent changes in land use have induced increased runoff, soil erosion and in-stream suspended sediment loads , and potential pathogen dissemination . to our knowledge, few studies have related diarrhea incidences to catchment scale hydrological factors such as river discharge, and loads of suspended sediment and of Fecal Indicator Bacteria ( FIB) such as Escherichia coli , together with sociological factors . we conducted a retrospective time series analysis of meteorological variables (rainfall, air temperature) , hydrological variables (discharge , suspended sediments, FI"
"The end-Permian mass extinction represents the most severe biotic crisis for the last 540 million years, and the marine ecosystem recovery from this extinction was protracted, spanning the entirety of the Early Triassic and possibly longer. Numerous studies from the low-latitude Paleotethys and high-latitude Boreal oceans have examined the possible link between ocean chemistry changes and the end-Permian mass extinction. However, redox chemistry changes in the Panthalassic Ocean, comprising ~85-90% of the global ocean area, remain under debate. Here, we report multiple S-isotopic data of pyrite from Upper Permian-Lower Triassic deep-sea sediments of the Panthalassic Ocean, now present in outcrops of western Canada and Japan. We find a sulfur isotope signal of negative D^33S with either positive d^34S or negative d^34S that implies mixing of sulfide sulfur with different d^34S before, during, and after the end-Permian mass extinction. The precise coincidence of the negative D^33S anomaly with the extinction horizon in western Canada suggests that shoaling of H2S-rich waters may have driven the end-Permian mass extinction. Our data also imply episodic euxinia and oscillations between sulfidic and oxic conditions during the earliest Triassic, providing evidence of a causal link between incursion of sulfidic waters and the delayed recovery of the marine ecosystem.","Significance To understand how most life on Earth went extinct 250 million years ago, we used multiple sulfur isotopes to investigate redox chemistry changes in the Panthalassic Ocean, comprising ~85-90% of the contemporaneous global ocean. The S-isotopic anomalies from Canada and Japan provide evidence for the timing of the onset of euxinia and mixing of sulfidic and oxic waters. Our data suggest that shoaling of H2S-rich waters may have driven the mass extinction and delayed the recovery of the marine ecosystem. This study illustrates how environmental changes could have had a devastating effect on Earth's early biosphere, and may have present-day relevance because global warming and eutrophication are causing development of sulfidic zones on modern continental shelves, threatening indigenous marine life.","the end-Permian mass extinction represents the most severe biotic crisis for the last 540 million years , and the marine ecosystem recovery from this extinction was protracted , spanning the entirety of the Early Triassic and possibly longer . however, redox chemistry changes in the panthalassic Ocean, comprising 85-90% of the global ocean area, remain under debate . here, we report multiple S-isotopic data of pyrite from Upper Permiaan-Lower triassic deep-sea sediments of western canada and Japan . we find a sulfur isotope signal of negative D33S"
"Background Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by chronic motor and vocal tics affecting up to 1% of school-age children and young people and is associated with significant distress and psychosocial impairment. Objective To conduct a systematic review of the benefits and risks of pharmacological, behavioural and physical interventions for tics in children and young people with TS (part 1) and to explore the experience of treatment and services from the perspective of young people with TS and their parents (part 2) . Data Sources For the systematic reviews (parts 1 and 2) , mainstream bibliographic databases, The Cochrane Library, education, social care and grey literature databases were searched using subject headings and text words for tic* and Tourette* from database inception to January 2013. Review/research methods For part 1, randomised controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies of pharmacological, behavioural or physical interventions in children or young people (aged < 18 years) with TS or chronic tic disorder were included. Mixed studies and studies in adults were considered as supporting evidence. Risk of bias associated with each study was evaluated using the Cochrane tool. When there was sufficient data, random-effects meta-analysis was used to synthesize the evidence and the quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. For part 2, qualitative studies and survey literature conducted in populations of children/young people with TS or their carers or in health professionals with experience of treating TS were included in the qualitative review. Results were synthesized narratively. In addition, a national parent/carer survey was conducted via the Tourettes Action website. Participants included parents of children and young people with TS aged under 18 years. Participants (young people with TS aged 10-17 years) for the in-depth interviews were recruited via a national survey and specialist Tourettes clinics in the UK. Results For part 1, 70 studies were included in the quantitative systematic review. The evidence suggested that for treating tics in children and young people with TS, antipsychotic drugs [standardised mean difference (SMD) -0. 74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1. 08 to -0. 41; n = 75] and noradrenergic agents [clonidine (Dixarit(r) , Boehringer Ingelheim) and guanfacine: SMD -0. 72, 95% CI -1. 03 to -0. 40; n = 164] are effective in the short term. There was little difference among antipsychotics in terms of benefits, but adverse effect profiles do differ. Habit reversal training (HRT) /comprehensive behavioural intervention for tics (CBIT) was also shown to be effective (SMD -0. 64, 95% CI -0. 99 to -0. 29; n = 133) . For part 2, 295 parents/carers of children and young people with TS contributed useable survey data. Forty young people with TS participated in in-depth interviews. Four studies were in the qualitative review. Key themes were difficulties in accessing specialist care and behavioural interventions, delay in diagnosis, importance of anxiety and emotional symptoms, lack of provision of information to schools and inadequate information regarding medication and adverse effects. Limitations The number and quality of clinical trials is low and this downgrades the strength of the evidence and conclusions. Conclusions Antipsychotics, noradrenergic agents and HRT/CBIT are effective in reducing tics in children and young people with TS. The balance of benefits and harms favours the most commonly used medications: risperidone (Risperdal(r) , Janssen) , clonidine and aripiprazole (Abilify(r) , Otsuka) . Larger and better-conducted trials addressing important clinical uncertainties are required. Further research is needed into widening access to behavioural interventions through use of technology including mobile applications ('apps') and video consultation.","Tourette syndrome ( TS) is a common condition affecting up to 1% of children and young people and is characterised by motor and vocal tics. TS frequently occurs together with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The main treatments for tics are medication and behavioural interventions. The study has two main components: part 1 - to identify from a systematic review of the published research literature of controlled trials which treatments for tics are most effective and part 2 - to understand from the perspective of young people with TS and their parents how they experienced treatment and care for TS, including which interventions they found helpful or harmful and what outcomes they valued most. Part 2 involved a national online survey of 358 parents/carers ( 295 contributing usable data) and in-depth interviews with 40 young people with TS. In the part 1, study a ntipsychotics and noradrenergic agents [clonidine ( Dixarit( r) , Boehringer Ingelheim) ] were found to be effective for treating tics in children and young people with TS. However, antipsychotics can cause troublesome adverse effects ( sedation, weight gain and neurological symptoms) and aripiprazole ( Abilify( r) , Otsuka) may be better tolerated than other antipsychotics. Habit reversal therapy was also found to be effective for treating tics. Overall, the number and quality of clinical trials is low and this downgrades the strength of the evidence and conclusions. Larger and better-conducted trials addressing important clinical uncertainties are required. The key themes identified in part 2 were difficulties in access to specialist care, delay in diagnosis, limited access to behavioural interventions ( only 25% of young people had a behavioural intervention) , the importance of anxiety and emotional symptoms in TS, lack of provision of information to schools and inadequate information regarding medication and adverse effects.","background Tourette syndrome ( TS) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by chronic motor and vocal tics affecting up to 1% of school-age children and young people and is associated with significant distress and psychosocial impairment . objective To conduct a systematic review of the benefits and risks of pharmacological, behavioural and physical interventions for tics in children and youth with TS and to explore the experience of treatment and services from the perspective of young people with t and their parents (part 2).methodsdata Sources , mainstream bibliographic databases , education, social care and grey literature databases were searched using subject headings and text words for tic* and Tourette* from database in"
"Among the physiological consequences of extended spaceflight are loss of skeletal muscle and bone mass. One signaling pathway that plays an important role in maintaining muscle and bone homeostasis is that regulated by the secreted signaling proteins, myostatin (MSTN) and activin A. Here, we used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the effect of targeting MSTN/activin A signaling in mice that were sent to the International Space Station. Wild type mice lost significant muscle and bone mass during the 33 d spent in microgravity. Muscle weights of Mstn^-/- mice, which are about twice those of wild type mice, were largely maintained during spaceflight. Systemic inhibition of MSTN/activin A signaling using a soluble form of the activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B) , which can bind each of these ligands, led to dramatic increases in both muscle and bone mass, with effects being comparable in ground and flight mice. Exposure to microgravity and treatment with the soluble receptor each led to alterations in numerous signaling pathways, which were reflected in changes in levels of key signaling components in the blood as well as their RNA expression levels in muscle and bone. These findings have implications for therapeutic strategies to combat the concomitant muscle and bone loss occurring in people afflicted with disuse atrophy on Earth as well as in astronauts in space, especially during prolonged missions.","Significance Among the major health challenges for astronauts during prolonged space travel are loss of muscle mass and loss of bone mass. Here, we investigated the effects of targeting the signaling pathway mediated by the secreted signaling molecules, myostatin and activin A, in mice sent to the International Space Station. We show that targeting this signaling pathway has significant beneficial effects in protecting against both muscle and bone loss in microgravity, suggesting that this strategy may be effective in preventing or treating muscle and bone loss not only in astronauts on prolonged missions but also in people with disuse atrophy on Earth, such as in older adults or in individuals who are bedridden or wheelchair-bound from illness.","myostatin (MSTN)/activin A signaling plays an important role in maintaining muscle and bone homeostasis is that regulated by the secreted signaling proteins, myostatein and activin A . here , we used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the effect of targeting MSTN-activina signaling in mice that were sent to the International Space Station . a soluble form of the activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B) , which can bind each of these ligands , led to dramatic increases in both muscle / bone mass during the 33 d spent in microgravity . these findings"
"A major process of iron homeostasis in whole-body iron metabolism is the release of iron from the macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Macrophages recognize and phagocytose senescent or damaged erythrocytes. Then, they process the heme iron, which is returned to the circulation for reutilization by red blood cell precursors during erythropoiesis. The amount of iron released, compared to the amount shunted for storage as ferritin, is greater during iron deficiency. A currently accepted model of iron release assumes a passive-gradient with free diffusion of intracellular labile iron (Fe2+) through ferroportin (FPN) , the transporter on the plasma membrane. Outside the cell, a multi-copper ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin (Cp) , oxidizes ferrous to ferric ion. Apo-transferrin (Tf) , the primary carrier of soluble iron in the plasma, binds ferric ion to form mono-ferric and di-ferric transferrin. According to the passive-gradient model, the removal of ferrous ion from the site of release sustains the gradient that maintains the iron release. Subcellular localization of FPN, however, indicates that the role of FPN may be more complex. By experiments and mathematical modeling, we have investigated the detailed mechanism of iron release from macrophages focusing on the roles of the Cp, FPN and apo-Tf. The passive-gradient model is quantitatively analyzed using a mathematical model for the first time. A comparison of experimental data with model simulations shows that the passive-gradient model cannot explain macrophage iron release. However, a facilitated-transport model associated with FPN can explain the iron release mechanism. According to the facilitated-transport model, intracellular FPN carries labile iron to the macrophage membrane. Extracellular Cp accelerates the oxidation of ferrous ion bound to FPN. Apo-Tf in the extracellular environment binds to the oxidized ferrous ion, completing the release process. Facilitated-transport model can correctly predict cellular iron efflux and is essential for physiologically relevant whole-body model of iron metabolism.","Iron metabolism is an important physiological phenomenon essential for sustaining life. There is a tight regulation of iron levels in humans and both deficiency and overload can lead to disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis. Recycling of iron in human body via macrophage iron release is crucial to maintain healthy iron levels. However, a computational model is needed to quantitatively analyze the mechanism underlying a key process in iron homeostasis, which is the release of iron from the macrophages. Using mechanistic, mathematical models to simulate experimental data, we found a novel mechanism by which macrophages release iron. A comparison of experimental data with model simulations shows that a currently accepted passive-gradient mechanism cannot represent the iron-release process from macrophages. However, our model with a facilitated-transport mechanism associated with ferroportin ( only known protein for iron export) accurately reproduces the iron release process. This model quantifies for the first time the detailed molecular mechanism associated with iron transport via ferroportin. This quantitative predictive model of cellular iron efflux is essential for physiologically relevant simulation of whole-body model of iron metabolism in healthy and disease states.","iron release from the macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system is a major process of iron homeostasis in whole-body iron metabolism . a currently accepted model of iron release assumes a passive-gradient with free diffusion of intracellular labile iron (Fe2+) through ferroportin (FPN) , the transporter on the plasma membrane , binds ferrous to ferric ion to form mono-ferric and di ferric transferrin . this model is quantitatively analyzed using a mathematical model for the first time . the active-grade model can correctly predict cellular iron eff"
"Background Phenylketonuria results from a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine keeps blood phenylalanine concentration low. Most natural foods are excluded from diet and supplements are used to supply other nutrients. Recent publications report a decrease in blood phenylalanine concentration in some patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride. We examined the evidence for the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride to treat phenylketonuria. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives To assess the safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in lowering blood phenylalanine concentration in people with phenylketonuria. Search methods We identified relevant trials from the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Date of last search: 11 August 2014. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and Current controlled trials. Last search: 4 September 2014 We contacted the manufacturers of the drug (BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.) for information regarding any unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing sapropterin with no supplementation or placebo in people with phenylketonuria due to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials and extracted outcome data. Main results Two placebo-controlled trials were included. One trial administered 10 mg/kg/day sapropterin in 89 children and adults with phenylketonuria whose diets were not restricted and who had previously responded to saproterin.This trial measured change in blood phenylalanine concentration. The second trial screened 90 children (4 to 12 years) with phenylketonuria whose diet was restricted, for responsiveness to sapropterin. Forty-six responders entered the placebo-controlled part of the trial and received 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin. This trial measured change in both phenylalanine concentration and protein tolerance. Both trials reported adverse events. The trials showed an overall low risk of bias; but both are Biomarin-sponsored. One trial showed a significant lowering in blood phenylalanine concentration in the sapropterin group (10 mg/kg/day), mean difference -238.80 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -343.09 to -134.51); a second trial (20 mg/kg/day sapropterin) showed a non-significant difference, mean difference -51.90 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -197.27 to 93.47). The second trial also reported a significant increase in phenylalanine tolerance, mean difference18.00 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval 12.28 to 23.72) in the 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin group. Authors' conclusions There is evidence of short-term benefit from using sapropterin in some people with sapropterin-responsive forms of phenylketonuria; blood phenylalanine concentration is lowered and protein tolerance increased. There are no serious adverse events associated with using sapropterin in the short term. There is no evidence on the long-term effects of sapropterin and no clear evidence of effectiveness in severe phenylketonuria.","The use of sapropterin to lower phenylalanine concentration in blood in people with phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria occurs due to an inherited deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. If untreated it causes an excessive accumulation of the amino acid phenylalanine in the body which prevents normal brain development. The established treatment for phenylketonuria consists of dietary restriction of natural protein but with prescribed phenylalanine-free amino acid, mineral and vitamin supplements. With this treatment the long-term outcome for people with phenylketonuria is excellent but the diet is onerous. Sapropterin dihydrochloride, the cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, could lower phenylalanine concentration significantly in phenylketonuria and might allow a relaxation of dietary restrictions. The review identified two trials of sapropterin dihydrochloride; one in children and adults with no restricted diet and one in just children whose diet was restricted. The trials used different doses of sapropterin dihydrochloride (10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day). We could not combine any data due to different formats of presentation. We found evidence to show that some people with mild or moderate phenylketonuria can benefit from the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride in the short term; the concentration of blood phenylalanine was lowered after treatment in both trials. The trial with the higher dose also measured the outcome change in protein tolerance. It reported an increase in protein tolerance in response to sapropterin. There were no adverse effects associated with the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride in the short term. We found no evidence on the effects of long-term treatment. We could not draw any conclusions on its benefits in severe phenylketonuria.","background Phenylketonuria results from a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.objectives:to assess the safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in lowering blood pythonine concentration in people with p  0.05.methods:this is an update of a previously published cochrane review . we examined the evidence for the use of n - dna -dnia , a placebo-controlled trial administered 10 mg/kg/day . a second trial administered a 10-mg/day dose of 20 mg/"
"Quorum sensing is a chemical communication process that bacteria use to coordinate group behaviors. In the global pathogen Vibrio cholerae, one quorum-sensing receptor and transcription factor, called VqmA (VqmAVc) , activates expression of the vqmR gene encoding the small regulatory RNA VqmR, which represses genes involved in virulence and biofilm formation. Vibriophage VP882 encodes a VqmA homolog called VqmAPhage that activates transcription of the phage gene qtip, and Qtip launches the phage lytic program. Curiously, VqmAPhage can activate vqmR expression but VqmAVc cannot activate expression of qtip. Here, we investigate the mechanism underlying this asymmetry. We find that promoter selectivity is driven by each VqmA DNA-binding domain and key DNA sequences in the vqmR and qtip promoters are required to maintain specificity. A protein sequence-guided mutagenesis approach revealed that the residue E194 of VqmAPhage and A192, the equivalent residue in VqmAVc, in the helix-turn-helix motifs contribute to promoter-binding specificity. A genetic screen to identify VqmAPhage mutants that are incapable of binding the qtip promoter but maintain binding to the vqmR promoter delivered additional VqmAPhage residues located immediately C-terminal to the helix-turn-helix motif as required for binding the qtip promoter. Surprisingly, these residues are conserved between VqmAPhage and VqmAVc. A second, targeted genetic screen revealed a region located in the VqmAVc DNA-binding domain that is necessary to prevent VqmAVc from binding the qtip promoter, thus restricting DNA binding to the vqmR promoter. We propose that the VqmAVc helix-turn-helix motif and the C-terminal flanking residues function together to prohibit VqmAVc from binding the qtip promoter.","Bacteria use a chemical communication process called quorum sensing ( QS) to orchestrate collective behaviors. Recent studies demonstrate that bacteria-infecting viruses, called phages, also employ chemical communication to regulate collective activities. Phages can encode virus-specific QS-like systems, or they can harbor genes encoding QS components resembling those of bacteria. The latter arrangement suggests the potential for chemical communication across domains, i. e. , between bacteria and phages. Ramifications stemming from such cross-domain communication are not understood. Phage VP882 infects the global pathogen Vibrio cholerae, and ""eavesdrops"" on V. cholerae QS to optimize the timing of its transition from existing as a parasite to killing the host, and moreover, to manipulate V. cholerae biology. To accomplish these feats, phage VP882 relies on VqmAPhage, the phage-encoded homolog of the V. cholerae VqmAVc QS receptor and transcription factor. VqmAVc, by contrast, is constrained to the control of only V. cholerae genes and is incapable of regulating phage biology. Here, we discover the molecular mechanism underpinning the asymmetric transcriptional preferences of the phage-encoded and bacteria-encoded VqmA proteins. We demonstrate how VqmA transcriptional regulation is crucial to the survival and persistence of both the pathogen V. cholerae, and the phage that preys on it.","the quorum-sensing receptor and transcription factor , called VqmA (VqmAVc ) , activates expression of the vqmR gene encoding the small regulatory RNA , which represses genes involved in virulence and biofilm formation . we find that promoter selectivity is driven by each VqMA DNA-binding domain and key DNA sequences in the qtip promoters are required to maintain specificity . here , we investigate the mechanism underlying this asymmetry ."
"Understanding the population dynamics of megafauna that inhabited the mammoth steppe provides insights into the causes of extinctions during both the terminal Pleistocene and today. Our study area is Alaska9s North Slope, a place where humans were rare when these extinctions occurred. After developing a statistical approach to remove the age artifacts caused by radiocarbon calibration from a large series of dated megafaunal bones, we compare the temporal patterns of bone abundance with climate records. Megafaunal abundance tracked ice age climate, peaking during transitions from cold to warm periods. These results suggest that a defining characteristic of the mammoth steppe was its temporal instability and imply that regional extinctions followed by population reestablishment from distant refugia were characteristic features of ice-age biogeography at high latitudes. It follows that long-distance dispersal was crucial for the long-term persistence of megafaunal species living in the Arctic. Such dispersal was only possible when their rapidly shifting range lands were geographically interconnected. The end of the last ice age was fatally unique because the geographic ranges of arctic megafauna became permanently fragmented after stable, interglacial climate engendered the spread of peatlands at the same time that rising sea level severed former dispersal routes.","Significance Understanding species extinction is a major concern today, and past extinctions provide valuable lessons. Numerous mammal species became extinct in the Arctic at the end of the ice age, but it is unclear why. By comparing numbers of dated bones with climate records, we find that megafaunal species, like mammoth, horse, and bison, experienced boom and bust cycles during the ice age as they tracked rapid climate changes. For these species to persist, long-distance dispersal was necessary. Their extinction on the North Slope occurred as the ice age ended, because rising sea level severed dispersal routes and spreading peat simultaneously degraded range quality. This finding suggests that arctic mammals can be resilient to environmental changes but only if their habitats remain widely interconnected.","the mammoth steppe is a place where humans were rare when these extinctions occurred . we compare the temporal patterns of bone abundance with climate records . megafaunal abundance tracked ice age climate , peaking during transitions from cold to warm periods . these results suggest that a defining characteristic of the molecular mammome was its temporal instability and imply that regional extinction followed by population reestablishment from distant refugia were characteristic features of ice-age biogeography at high latitudes . the extinction of megafavia was fatally unique because the geographic ranges of arctic megafouna became"
"The lower an individual's socioeconomic position, the higher their risk of poor health in low-, middle-, and high-income settings alike. As health inequities grow, it is imperative that we develop an empirically-driven mechanistic understanding of the determinants of health disparities, and capture disease burden in at-risk populations to prevent exacerbation of disparities. Past work has been limited in data or scope and has thus fallen short of generalizable insights. Here, we integrate empirical data from observational studies and large-scale healthcare data with models to characterize the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of health disparities in an infectious disease case study: influenza. We find that variation in social and healthcare-based determinants exacerbates influenza epidemics, and that low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals disproportionately bear the burden of infection. We also identify geographical hotspots of influenza burden in low SES populations, much of which is overlooked in traditional influenza surveillance, and find that these differences are most predicted by variation in susceptibility and access to sickness absenteeism. Our results highlight that the effect of overlapping factors is synergistic and that reducing this intersectionality can significantly reduce inequities. Additionally, health disparities are expressed geographically, and targeting public health efforts spatially may be an efficient use of resources to abate inequities. The association between health and socioeconomic prosperity has a long history in the epidemiological literature; addressing health inequities in respiratory-transmitted infectious disease burden is an important step towards social justice in public health, and ignoring them promises to pose a serious threat.","Health inequities, or increased morbidity and mortality due to social factors, have been demonstrated for respiratory-transmitted infectious diseases, most recently highlighted by disparities in COVID-19 severe cases and deaths. Many potential causes of these inequities have been proposed, but they have not been compared, and we do not understand their population-scale impacts. Our understanding of these issues is further hindered by epidemiological surveillance, which has been shown to overlook areas of low socioeconomic status. Here, we combine mechanistic and statistical modeling with high volume datasets to disentangle the drivers of respiratory-transmitted disease disparities, and to estimate locations where these health inequities are most severe, using influenza as a case study. We show that low socioeconomic status individuals disproportionately bear the burden of influenza infection, and that all proposed factors are synergistic in their effect. Additionally we identify geographical hotspots of poor disease surveillance among populations of low socioeconomic status, which contribute to an underestimation of health disparities. As the divide in health inequities, driven by income inequality and systemic racism, grows wider across the United States, we highlight the need to understand the mechanisms that may be at the root of disparities, and we advocate for the prioritization of capabilities to monitor outbreaks in at-risk populations so that we may prevent exacerbation of inequities.","addressing health disparities in respiratory-transmitted infectious disease burden is an important step towards social justice in public health , and ignoring them promises to pose a serious threat . as health inequities grow, it is imperative that we develop an empirically-driven mechanistic understanding of the determinants of health disparity, and capture disease burden in at-risk populations to prevent exacerbation of disparities . here, we integrate empirical data from observational studies and large-scale healthcare data with models to characterize the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of health in an infectious disease case study: influenza . we find that variation in social and healthcare-based determinant exacerbates"
"Polygenic scores quantify the genetic risk associated with a given phenotype and are widely used to predict the risk of complex diseases. There has been recent interest in developing methods to construct polygenic risk scores using summary statistic data. We propose a method to construct polygenic risk scores via penalized regression using summary statistic data and publicly available reference data. Our method bears similarity to existing method LassoSum, extending their framework to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) and the elastic net. We show via simulation and real data application that the TLP improves predictive accuracy as compared to the LASSO while imposing additional sparsity where appropriate. To facilitate model selection in the absence of validation data, we propose methods for estimating model fitting criteria AIC and BIC. These methods approximate the AIC and BIC in the case where we have a polygenic risk score estimated on summary statistic data and no validation data. Additionally, we propose the so-called quasi-correlation metric, which quantifies the predictive accuracy of a polygenic risk score applied to out-of-sample data for which we have only summary statistic information. In total, these methods facilitate estimation and model selection of polygenic risk scores on summary statistic data, and the application of these polygenic risk scores to out-of-sample data for which we have only summary statistic information. We demonstrate the utility of these methods by applying them to GWA studies of lipids, height, and lung cancer.","Polygenic risk scores use genetic data to predict the genetic risk associated with a given phenotype. Often, due to privacy concerns, genetic data is provided in a limited format called summary statistics. This means that we have limited data with which to estimate polygenic risk scores and cannot apply many standard modelling techniques. We provide novel methods for the estimation of polygenic risk scores via penalized regression using summary statistics, and make software available to do this estimation. We also provide novel methods for model selection and the assessment of model performance in the summary statistic framework. In total, this enables us to use summary statistic data to estimate polygenic risk scores, select a polygenic risk score from among a set of candidate models, and assess the performance of these models. This allows us to leverage summary statistic data to better understand genetic risk.

"Dengue has become a more serious human health concern in China, with increased incidence and expanded outbreak regions. The knowledge of the cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiological characteristics and the evolutionary dynamics of dengue in high-risk areas of China is limited. Records of dengue cases from 2013 to 2016 were obtained from the China Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Full envelope gene sequences of dengue viruses detected from the high-risk areas of China were collected. Maximum Likelihood tree and haplotype network analyses were conducted to explore the phylogenetic relationship of viruses from high-risk areas of China. A total of 56, 520 cases was reported in China from 2013 to 2016. During this time, Yunnan, Guangdong and Fujian provinces were the high-risk areas. Imported cases occurred almost year-round, and were mainly introduced from Southeast Asia. The first indigenous case usually occurred in June to August, and the last one occurred before December in Yunnan and Fujian provinces but in December in Guangdong Province. Seven genotypes of DENV 1-3 were detected in the high-risk areas, with DENV 1-I the main genotype and DENV 2-Cosmopolitan the secondary one. The Maximum Likelihood trees show that almost all the indigenous viruses separated into different clusters. DENV 1-I viruses were found to be clustered in Guangdong Province, but not in Fujian and Yunnan, from 2013 to 2015. The ancestors of the Guangdong viruses in the cluster in 2013 and 2014 were most closely related to strains from Thailand or Singapore, and the Guangdong virus in 2015 was most closely related to the Guangdong virus of 2014. Based on closest phylogenetic relationships, viruses from Myanmar possibly initiated further indigenous cases in Yunnan, those from Indonesia in Fujian, while viruses from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia were predominant in Guangdong Province. Dengue is still an imported disease in China, although some genotypes continued to circulate in successive years. Viral phylogenies based on the envelope gene suggested periodic introductions of dengue strains into China, primarily from Southeast Asia, with occasional sustained, multi-year transmission in some regions of China.","Dengue is the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease globally. Because of the multiple introductions, dengue outbreaks occurred in epidemic seasons in Southern China, supported by suitable weather conditions. Surveillance data from 2013 to 2016 in China showed that Guangdong, Yunnan and Fujian provinces were the high-risk areas, with dengue outbreaks occurring almost every year. However, knowledge has been lacking of the epidemiological characteristics and the evolution pattern of dengue virus in these high-risk areas. This study shows a variety of epidemiological characteristics and sources of imported cases among the high-risk areas in China, with likely origins primarily from countries in Southeast Asia. Seven genotypes of the DENV 1-3 variety co-circulated with DENV1-I, the main genotype, and DENV 2-Cosmopolitan, the secondary. Genetic relationships among viral strains suggest that the indigenous viruses in the high-risk areas arose from imported viruses and sometimes persisted between years into the next epidemic season, especially in Guangdong Province. Population movement has played a vital role in dengue epidemics in China. This information may be useful in dengue control, especially during epidemic seasons and in the development of an early warning system within the region, in collaboration with bordering countries.","background : dengue has become a more serious human health concern in China , with increased incidence and expanded outbreak regions . the knowledge of the cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiological characteristics and the evolutionary dynamics of dengue in high-risk areas of China is limited.materials and methods : a total of 56, 520 cases were reported in China from 2013 to 2016.results:the first indigenous case usually occurred in June to August , and the last one occurred before December in Yunnan and Fujian provinces but in December in Guangdong provinces . in this time, the first indigenous cases usually occurred almost year-round, and were mainly introduced from Southeast"
"Zoonoses account for the most commonly reported emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is limited knowledge on how pastoral communities perceive zoonoses in relation to their livelihoods, culture and their wider ecology. This study was carried out to explore local knowledge and perceptions on zoonoses among pastoralists in Tanzania. This study involved pastoralists in Ngorongoro district in northern Tanzania and Kibaha and Bagamoyo districts in eastern Tanzania. Qualitative methods of focus group discussions, participatory epidemiology and interviews were used. A total of 223 people were involved in the study. Among the pastoralists, there was no specific term in their local language that describes zoonosis. Pastoralists from northern Tanzania possessed a higher understanding on the existence of a number of zoonoses than their eastern districts' counterparts. Understanding of zoonoses could be categorized into two broad groups: a local syndromic framework, whereby specific symptoms of a particular illness in humans concurred with symptoms in animals, and the biomedical framework, where a case definition is supported by diagnostic tests. Some pastoralists understand the possibility of some infections that could cross over to humans from animals but harm from these are generally tolerated and are not considered as threats. A number of social and cultural practices aimed at maintaining specific cultural functions including social cohesion and rites of passage involve animal products, which present zoonotic risk. These findings show how zoonoses are locally understood, and how epidemiology and biomedicine are shaping pastoralists perceptions to zoonoses. Evidence is needed to understand better the true burden and impact of zoonoses in these communities. More studies are needed that seek to clarify the common understanding of zoonoses that could be used to guide effective and locally relevant interventions. Such studies should consider in their approaches the pastoralists' wider social, cultural and economic set up.","Zoonoses are diseases transmissible between animals and humans. Risk factors include animal slaughter, the handling and preparing food of animal origin and particularly the consumption of such food when raw or undercooked. Pastoralists are daily in contact with their livestock and are likely to be more frequently exposed to zoonotic pathogens. However, very few studies have focused on the understanding of zoonoses and related risk factors among pastoralists of Tanzania. This was striking considering pastoralists' close bond with and reliance on livestock for their nutritional needs and livelihoods. Our study was implemented in pastoral communities located in two different ecological zones of Tanzania. In all ten communities visited no local term for zoonoses existed, yet participants recognised there are some symptoms that appear in both animals and humans. However, these were not thought to be harmful to humans and people did not perceive the animal products from which they originate to be dangerous. Other zoonoses were known because community members received a diagnosis from a health facility. We also learnt that cultural practices relating to the preparation and consumption of food of animal origin were considered more important to the community than the risk of infection. The findings of this study highlight the gaps in knowledge of zoonoses among pastoralists in Tanzania and the importance of social and cultural practices. Therefore, we propose that interventions to control zoonoses should be informed by research of peoples' behaviours related to handling of animals and consumption of animal source foods.","background : zoonoses account for the most commonly reported emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-saharan Africa.objectives:this study was carried out to explore local knowledge and perceptions on zeanoses among pastoralists in Tanzania.materials and methods:a total of 223 people were involved in the study.results:there was no specific term in their local language that describes zealnosis.conclusion:a number of social and cultural practices aimed at maintaining specific cultural functions including social cohesion and rites of passage involve animal products , which present a case definition is supported by diagnostic tests .

"Normal leaf margin development is important for leaf morphogenesis and contributes to diverse leaf shapes in higher plants. We here show the crucial roles of an atypical type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, PI4Kg5, in Arabidopsis leaf margin development. PI4Kg5 presents a dynamics expression pattern along with leaf development and a T-DNA mutant lacking PI4Kg5, pi4kg5-1, presents serrated leaves, which is resulted from the accelerated cell division and increased auxin concentration at serration tips. Studies revealed that PI4Kg5 interacts with and phosphorylates a membrane-bound NAC transcription factor, ANAC078. Previous studies demonstrated that membrane-bound transcription factors regulate gene transcription by undergoing proteolytic process to translocate into nucleus, and ANAC078 undergoes proteolysis by cleaving off the transmembrane region and carboxyl terminal. Western blot analysis indeed showed that ANAC078 deleting of carboxyl terminal is significantly reduced in pi4kg5-1, indicating that PI4Kg5 is important for the cleavage of ANAC078. This is consistent with the subcellular localization observation showing that fluorescence by GFP-ANAC078 is detected at plasma membrane but not nucleus in pi4kg5-1 mutant and that expression of ANAC078 deleting of carboxyl terminal, driven by PI4Kg5 promoter, could rescue the leaf serration defects of pi4kg5-1. Further analysis showed that ANAC078 suppresses the auxin synthesis by directly binding and regulating the expression of auxin synthesis-related genes. These results indicate that PI4Kg5 interacts with ANAC078 to negatively regulate auxin synthesis and hence influences cell proliferation and leaf development, providing informative clues for the regulation of in situ auxin synthesis and cell division, as well as the cleavage and functional mechanism of membrane-bound transcription factors.","Transcription factors ( TFs) regulate the expression of target genes at nucleus, while interestingly, a few of TFs locate at plasma membrane or ER membrane, stored as resting precursors to secure a rapid response post endogenous or environmental stimuli. Membrane-bound TFs undergo post-translational processing to be liberated and translocate into the nucleus. There are two kinds of liberating mechanisms: regulated intramembrane proteolysis ( RIP) by certain membrane-associated proteases and regulated ubiquitin/26S proteasome-dependent processing ( RUP) . However, the detailed regulatory mechanism is largely unclear. By studying a T-DNA mutant lacking an atypical type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase ( PI4Kg5) , pi4kg5-1, which presents serrated leaves that resulted from the accelerated cell division and increased auxin concentration at serration tips, we here showed the crucial roles of PI4Kg5 on the function of membrane-bound TFs, possibly through a phosphorylation-dependent process. Yeast two-hybrid screening identifies ANAC078, a plasma membrane-bound NAC family TF that contains a one-pass transmembrane and undergoes RIP for release, an interacting TF of PI4Kg5. Biochemical analysis reveal that PI4Kg5 phosphorylates ANAC078 and further genetic analysis confirmed that PI4Kg5 is crucial for the cleavage and normal function of ANAC078, indicating that PI4Kg5-ANAC078 module downregulates auxin level during leaf development ( serration) . These findings provide new insights into the regulatory and functional mechanism of membrane-bound TFs and in situ auxin synthesis and effects during leaf morphogenesis.","atypical type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase , PI4Kg5, presents a dynamics expression pattern along with leaf development and a T-DNA mutant lacking p4kg5-1, presents serrated leaves , which is resulted from the accelerated cell division and increased auxin concentration at serration tips . studies revealed that a membrane-bound NAC transcription factor, ANAC078 , undergoes proteolysis by cleaving off the transmembrane region and carboxyl terminal , could rescue the leaf serration defects of apnea . further analysis showed that "
"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the most important virulence and antigenic components of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis. LPS diversity in B. pseudomallei has been described as typical, atypical or rough, based upon banding patterns on SDS-PAGE. Here, we studied the genetic and molecular basis of these phenotypic differences. Bioinformatics was used to determine the diversity of genes known or predicted to be involved in biosynthesis of the O-antigenic moiety of LPS in B. pseudomallei and its near-relative species. Multiplex-PCR assays were developed to target diversity of the O-antigen biosynthesis gene patterns or LPS genotypes in B. pseudomallei populations. We found that the typical LPS genotype (LPS genotype A) was highly prevalent in strains from Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia, whereas the atypical LPS genotype (LPS genotype B) was most often detected in Australian strains (~13. 8%) . In addition, we report a novel LPS ladder pattern, a derivative of the atypical LPS phenotype, associated with an uncommon O-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster that is found in only a small B. pseudomallei sub-population. This new LPS group was designated as genotype B2. We also report natural mutations in the O-antigen biosynthesis genes that potentially cause the rough LPS phenotype. We postulate that the diversity of LPS may correlate with differential immunopathogenicity and virulence among B. pseudomallei strains.","Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental Gram-negative bacterium and the cause of melioidosis, an often life-threatening disease affecting people in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Melioidosis is usually contracted by bacterial inoculation, ingestion or inhalation. Effective vaccines for melioidosis are currently unavailable. This organism contains a large genome, which varies greatly among strains due to a high frequency of genetic recombination. We report here on diversity of lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) in this species, a major component of the bacterial outer membrane and a known immunogenic virulence factor. We developed LPS genotyping techniques to study frequency of two major LPS types, known as typical and atypical LPS, in B. pseudomallei strains collected from two endemic regions: Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. LPS genotype variation differed among B. pseudomallei populations. During the investigation, we discovered a new LPS genotype in a sub-population group of B. pseudomallei in Australia.

"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been proposed for diagnosis, staging and post-treatment follow-up of sleeping sickness but no large-scale clinical evaluations of its diagnostic accuracy have taken place yet. An 18S ribosomal RNA gene targeting PCR was performed on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 360 T. brucei gambiense sleeping sickness patients and on blood of 129 endemic controls from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sensitivity and specificity (with 95% confidence intervals) of PCR for diagnosis, disease staging and treatment failure over 2 years follow-up post-treatment were determined. Reference standard tests were trypanosome detection for diagnosis and trypanosome detection and/or increased white blood cell concentration in CSF for staging and detection of treatment failure. PCR on blood showed a sensitivity of 88. 4% (84. 4-92. 5%) and a specificity of 99. 2% (97. 7-100%) for diagnosis, while for disease staging the sensitivity and specificity of PCR on cerebrospinal fluid were 88. 4% (84. 8-91. 9%) and 82. 9% (71. 2-94. 6%) , respectively. During follow-up after treatment, PCR on blood had low sensitivity to detect treatment failure. In cerebrospinal fluid, PCR positivity vanished slowly and was observed until the end of the 2 year follow-up in around 20% of successfully treated patients. For T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness diagnosis and staging, PCR performed better than, or similar to, the current parasite detection techniques but it cannot be used for post-treatment follow-up. Continued PCR positivity in one out of five cured patients points to persistence of living or dead parasites or their DNA after successful treatment and may necessitate the revision of some paradigms about the pathophysiology of sleeping sickness.","Post-treatment follow-up is crucial for sleeping sickness patient management and still relies on microscopic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) . Detection of the parasites DNA with the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) is proposed as a promising and possibly non-invasive alternative for monitoring treatment outcome, but has never been evaluated. We performed PCR on blood and CSF of 360 Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness patients, before treatment and during 2 years after treatment, and on blood of 129 controls. We found that performance of PCR to diagnose sleeping sickness and detect brain involvement was better or similar to current diagnostic techniques. However, we observed that PCR was unreliable for monitoring treatment outcome. Continued PCR positivity in cured patients points to persistence of parasites, or their DNA, after successful treatment, challenging the dogma that in sleeping sickness cure equals parasite elimination.

"For most species, light represents the principal environmental signal for entraining the endogenous circadian clock. The zebrafish is a fascinating vertebrate model for studying this process since unlike mammals, direct exposure of most of its tissues to light leads to local clock entrainment. Importantly, light induces the expression of a set of genes including certain clock genes in most zebrafish cell types in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism linking light to gene expression remains poorly understood. To elucidate this key mechanism, here we focus on how light regulates transcription of the zebrafish period2 (per2) gene. Using transgenic fish and stably transfected cell line-based assays, we define a Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the per2 promoter. The LRM lies proximal to the transcription start site and is both necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and also for a light-dependent circadian clock regulation. Curiously, the LRM sequence is strongly conserved in other vertebrate per2 genes, even in species lacking directly light-sensitive peripheral clocks. Furthermore, we reveal that the human LRM can substitute for the zebrafish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zebrafish cells. The LRM contains E- and D-box elements that are critical for its function. While the E-box directs circadian clock regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK activity, the D-box confers light-driven expression. The zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. We demonstrate that tef mRNA levels are light inducible and that knock-down of tef expression attenuates light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo. Together, our results support a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression. These findings extend the general understanding of the mechanism whereby the clock is entrained by light and how the regulation of clock gene expression by light has evolved in vertebrates.","Light is the principal signal used by animals to synchronize their circadian clocks with the day/night environment. Central to this vital property is the ability of light to trigger changes in gene expression. However, we still lack a complete understanding of how this occurs. The zebrafish is particularly interesting in this regard since direct light exposure induces the expression of clock genes in most of its tissues and in turn adjusts the phase of the intrinsic clocks. Here, by studying the promoter of one key light-regulated zebrafish clock gene, per2, we have identified a Light Responsive Module ( LRM) that is necessary and sufficient for light controlled expression. Interestingly, the LRM is also highly conserved in the per2 genes of other vertebrates that lack widespread light-sensing tissues. In addition, the human LRM can substitute for its zebrafish counterpart to confer direct light regulation of gene expression in zebrafish cells. The LRM contains E- and D-box enhancers critical for its function. While the E-box is a target of clock regulation, the D-box directs light driven expression. We show that the expression of the D-box binding transcription factor, tef, is itself induced by light and is essential for normal light-induced per2 expression. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying entrainment by light and how light-regulated clock gene expression has evolved in vertebrates.","light regulates transcription of the zebrafish period2 (per2) gene . to elucidate this key mechanism , here we define a light-responsive module (LRM) within the per2 promoter . utilizing transgenic fish and stably transfected cell line-based assays , we define the LRM proximal to the transcription start site and is both necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and also for a lighting-dependent circadian clock regulation . we demonstrate that tef mRNA levels are light inducible and that knock-down of the D-box attenuates light-regulated transcription from"
"Nucleosome occupancy controls the accessibility of the transcription machinery to DNA regulatory regions and serves an instructive role for gene expression. Chromatin remodelers, such as the BAF complexes, are responsible for establishing nucleosome occupancy patterns, which are key to epigenetic regulation along with DNA methylation and histone modifications. Some reports have assessed the roles of the BAF complex subunits and stemness in murine embryonic stem cells. However, the details of the relationships between remodelers and transcription factors in altering chromatin configuration, which ultimately affects gene expression during cell differentiation, remain unclear. Here for the first time we demonstrate that SNF5, a core subunit of the BAF complex, negatively regulates OCT4 levels in pluripotent cells and is essential for cell survival during differentiation. SNF5 is responsible for generating nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) at the regulatory sites of OCT4 repressed target genes such as PAX6 and NEUROG1, which are crucial for cell fate determination. Concurrently, SNF5 closes the NDRs at the regulatory regions of OCT4-activated target genes such as OCT4 itself and NANOG. Furthermore, using loss- and gain-of-function experiments followed by extensive genome-wide analyses including gene expression microarrays and ChIP-sequencing, we highlight that SNF5 plays dual roles during differentiation by antagonizing the expression of genes that were either activated or repressed by OCT4, respectively. Together, we demonstrate that SNF5 executes the switch between pluripotency and differentiation.","DNA is packaged with proteins into higher-order chromatin structures, which makes genes inherently resistant to transcription initiation. The importance of chromatin remodelers in inducing structural changes to chromatin and, therefore, in controlling the expression of genes has recently resurfaced with the realization that several of them are mutated in human cancers. SNF5, which serves as the core subunit of the BAF remodeling complex, is one such remodeler. In this study, we identify the role of SNF5 induced chromatin remodeling in cell differentiation, the commitment of embryonic cells to a mature lineage-committed state. Importantly, we find that SNF5 establishes appropriate chromatin remodeling patterns during differentiation by controlling the levels of the OCT4 protein, the master determinant of the undifferentiated state. On receipt of differentiation cues, SNF5 opens the chromatin of repressed genes that are occupied by OCT4. SNF5 also induces the closing of genes that are being actively transcribed and OCT4 bound. Further, we show that SNF5 is necessary for cell survival during differentiation, highlighting its crucial role in the process. Together, our data shed novel insights on the importance of SNF5 in maintaining the balance between the embryonic and differentiated states.","nucleosome occupancy controls the accessibility of the transcription machinery to DNA regulatory regions and serves an instructive role for gene expression . however, the details of the relationships between remodelers and transcription factors in altering chromatin configuration, which ultimately affects gene expression during cell differentiation remain unclear . here for the first time we demonstrate that SNF5, a core subunit of the BAF complex, negatively regulates OCT4 levels in pluripotent cells and is essential for cell survival during differentiation ."
"Background Despite the widespread use of antenatal corticosteroids to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants, there is currently no consensus as to the type of corticosteroid to use; nor the dose, frequency, timing of use or the route of administration. Objectives To assess the effects of different corticosteroid regimens for women at risk of preterm birth. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 February 2013). Selection criteria All identified published and unpublished randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised control trials comparing any two corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone or any other corticosteroid that can cross the placenta), comparing different dose regimens (including frequency and timing of administration) in women at risk of preterm birth were included. We planned to exclude cross-over trials and cluster-randomised trials. We included studies published as abstracts only along with studies published as full-text manuscripts Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results For this update, 12 trials (1557 women and 1661 infants) were included. Dexamethasone was associated with a reduced risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) compared with betamethasone (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.92; four trials, 549 infants). No statistically significant differences were seen for other primary outcomes: respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.27; five trials, 753 infants) and perinatal death (neonatal death RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.67; four trials, 596 infants). Similarly, very few differences were seen for secondary outcomes such as rate of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) although in one trial, those infants exposed to dexamethasone, compared with betamethasone, had a significantly shorter length of NICU admission (mean difference (MD) -0.91 days, 95% CI -1.77 to -0.05; 70 infants). Results for biophysical parameters were inconsistent, but mostly no clinically important differences were seen. Compared with intramuscular dexamethasone, oral dexamethasone significantly increased the incidence of neonatal sepsis (RR 8.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 64.93) in one trial of 183 infants. No statistically significant differences were seen for other outcomes reported. Apart from a reduced maternal postpartum length of stay for women who received betamethasone at 12-hourly intervals compared to 24-hourly intervals in one trial (MD -0.73 days, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.18; 215 women), no differences in maternal or neonatal outcomes were seen between the different betamethasone dosing intervals assessed. Similarly, no significant differences in outcomes were seen when betamethasone acetate and phosphate was compared with betamethasone phosphate in one trial. Authors' conclusions It remains unclear whether one corticosteroid (or one particular regimen) has advantages over another. Dexamethasone may have some benefits compared with betamethasone such as less IVH, and a shorter length of stay in the NICU. The intramuscular route may have advantages over the oral route for dexamethasone, as identified in one small trial. Apart from the suggestion that 12-hour dosing may be as effective as 24-hour dosing of betamethasone based on one small trial, few other conclusions about optimal antenatal corticosteroid regimens were able to be made. No long-term results were available except for a small subgroup of 18 month old children in one trial. Trials comparing the commonly used corticosteroids are most urgently needed, as are trials of dosages and other variations in treatment regimens.","Corticosteroid treatments before early birth for reducing death, lung problems and brain haemorrhage in babies Babies born early are at risk of death, lung problems (respiratory distress syndrome) and bleeding of the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage). Corticosteroids are given to the mother to help stop these problems occurring and there is high-quality evidence that they are effective in preventing many of these problems. These drugs work by maturing the baby's lungs before birth. There are different types of corticosteroids and they can be given in different ways and in different doses. Since there is no clear or agreed best type or dose, hospitals may vary in how they give this drug. Most trials have compared the two most commonly used corticosteroids before early birth, dexamethasone and betamethasone. In this review of 12 trials (involving 1557 women and 1661 infants) of moderate quality, 10 trials compared dexamethasone and betamethasone; one trial compared two different ways of giving dexamethasone and one trial compared two different ways of giving betamethasone. We found that dexamethasone and betamethasone showed similar results, although there was less bleeding of the brain and a shorter length of neonatal intensive care unit hospital stay for dexamethasone compared with betamethasone. On the basis of one trial, giving dexamethasone by injection (intramuscularly) may be better than giving the drug to the mother by mouth (orally). Usually the drug is given in two doses 24 hours apart and one trial showed that this interval could perhaps be reduced to 12 hours if required. We need more studies to establish which is the best drug and what is the best way to give it, and babies in these trials need to be followed up over a long period to monitor any effects on child and adult development.","background : despite the widespread use of antenatal corticosteroids to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants, there is currently no consensus as to the type of corticotic to use; nor the dose, frequency, timing of use or the route of administration.objectives:to assess the effects of different corticostoids for women at risk of preterm birth.methods:we searched the cochrane pregnancy and childbirth group's trials register (13 February 2013).resultswe included 12 trials (5757 women and 1661 infants) comparing any two corticoids (dexamethasone or betamethatone or any other"
"Climate change and variability influence temperature and rainfall, which impact vector abundance and the dynamics of vector-borne disease transmission. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events. Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, are primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Freshwater availability and temperature affect dengue vector populations via a variety of biological processes and thus influence the ability of mosquitoes to effectively transmit disease. However, the effect of droughts, floods, heat waves, and cold waves is not well understood. Using vector, climate, and dengue disease data collected between 2013 and 2019 in Kenya, this retrospective cohort study aims to elucidate the impact of extreme rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the risk of arboviral infections. To define extreme periods of rainfall and land surface temperature (LST) , we calculated monthly anomalies as deviations from long-term means (1983-2019 for rainfall, 2000-2019 for LST) across four study locations in Kenya. We classified extreme climate events as the upper and lower 10% of these calculated LST or rainfall deviations. Monthly Ae. aegypti abundance was recorded in Kenya using four trapping methods. Blood samples were also collected from children with febrile illness presenting to four field sites and tested for dengue virus using an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . We found that mosquito eggs and adults were significantly more abundant one month following an abnormally wet month. The relationship between mosquito abundance and dengue risk follows a non-linear association. Our findings suggest that early warnings and targeted interventions during periods of abnormal rainfall and temperature, especially flooding, can potentially contribute to reductions in risk of viral transmission.","Dengue is a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne disease transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. As climate change leads to extremes in rainfall and temperature, the abundance and populations of these vectors will be affected, thus influencing transmission of dengue. Using satellite-derived climate data for Kenya, we classified months that experienced highly abnormal rainfall and temperature as extreme climate events ( floods, droughts, heat waves, or cold waves) . We compared the average monthly Ae. aegypti abundance and confirmed dengue counts following extreme climate months using lag periods of one month and two months, respectively. This study utilized several statistical models to account for differences among study sites and time. Floods resulted in significantly increased egg and adult abundance. Our results contributed to a better understanding of the effect of climate variability and change on dengue. As suggested by our observed increase in vector counts yet a relatively unchanged dengue infection risk, human behavior can help reduce viral transmission. Targeted interventions should be focused on both reducing vector populations and limiting human-vector contact, especially during these climate anomalies.","background : climate change and variability influence temperature and rainfall , which impact vector abundance and the dynamics of vector-borne disease transmission.objectives:to define extreme periods of rainfall and land surface temperature (LST ) , we calculated monthly anomalies as deviations from long-term means ( 1983-2019 for rainfall ) across four study locations in Kenya.materials and methods : this retrospective cohort study aims to elucidate the impact of extreme rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and risk of arboviral infections.results:we found that mosquito eggs and adults were significantly more abundant one month following an abnormally wet month . we found that early warnings and targeted interventions during"
"Sustainable land-system transformations are necessary to avert biodiversity and climate collapse. However, it remains unclear where entry points for transformations exist in complex land systems. Here, we conceptualize land systems along land-use trajectories, which allows us to identify and evaluate leverage points, i. e. , entry points on the trajectory where targeted interventions have particular leverage to influence land-use decisions. We apply this framework in the biodiversity hotspot Madagascar. In the northeast, smallholder agriculture results in a land-use trajectory originating in old-growth forests and spanning from forest fragments to shifting hill rice cultivation and vanilla agroforests. Integrating interdisciplinary empirical data on seven taxa, five ecosystem services, and three measures of agricultural productivity, we assess trade-offs and cobenefits of land-use decisions at three leverage points along the trajectory. These trade-offs and cobenefits differ between leverage points: Two leverage points are situated at the conversion of old-growth forests and forest fragments to shifting cultivation and agroforestry, resulting in considerable trade-offs, especially between endemic biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Here, interventions enabling smallholders to conserve forests are necessary. This is urgent since ongoing forest loss threatens to eliminate these leverage points due to path dependency. The third leverage point allows for the restoration of land under shifting cultivation through vanilla agroforests and offers cobenefits between restoration goals and agricultural productivity. The co-occurring leverage points highlight that conservation and restoration are simultaneously necessary to avert collapse of multifunctional mosaic landscapes. Methodologically, the framework highlights the importance of considering path dependency along trajectories to achieve sustainable land-system transformations.","Significance Finding entry points where policy has strong leverage to transform land systems for people and nature is pivotal. We develop an innovative framework to identify and evaluate such leverage points along land-use trajectories that account for path dependency. Applied to the biodiversity hotspot Madagascar, the framework reveals three leverage points: Two leverage points are associated with trade-offs between biodiversity, ecosystem services, and agricultural productivity, while the third entails cobenefits. Swift policy action is required, as path dependency caused by forest loss may soon put two leverage points out of reach. We argue that such closing windows of opportunity may be common, but often overlooked, calling for a wider consideration of path dependency in land-system science.","background : sustainable land-system transformations are necessary to avert biodiversity and climate collapse . however, it remains unclear where entry points for transformation exist in complex land systems . here, we conceptualize land systems along land-use trajectories , which allows us to identify and evaluate leverage points , i. e. , entry points on the trajectory where targeted interventions have particular leverage to influence land-user decisions.methods:we apply this framework in the biodiversity hotspot Madagascar.resultsin the northeast, smallholder agriculture results in an old-growth forest trajectory spanning from forest fragments to shifting hill rice cultivation and vanilla agroforests ."
"Glycolysis plays a fundamental role in energy production and metabolic homeostasis. The intracellular [adenosine triphosphate]/[adenosine diphosphate] ([ATP]/[ADP]) ratio controls glycolytic flux; however, the regulatory mechanism underlying reactions catalyzed by individual glycolytic enzymes enabling flux adaptation remains incompletely understood. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) catalyzes the reversible phosphotransfer reaction, which directly produces ATP in a near-equilibrium step of glycolysis. Despite extensive studies on the transcriptional regulation of PGK expression, the mechanism in response to changes in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio remains obscure. Here, we report a protein-level regulation of human PGK (hPGK) by utilizing the switching ligand-binding cooperativities between adenine nucleotides and 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) . This was revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at physiological salt concentrations. MgADP and 3PG bind to hPGK with negative cooperativity, whereas MgAMPPNP (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog) and 3PG bind to hPGK with positive cooperativity. These opposite cooperativities enable a shift between different ligand-bound states depending on the intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. Based on these findings, we present an atomic-scale description of the reaction scheme for hPGK under physiological conditions. Our results indicate that hPGK intrinsically modulates its function via ligand-binding cooperativities that are finely tuned to respond to changes in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. The alteration of ligand-binding cooperativities could be one of the self-regulatory mechanisms for enzymes in bidirectional pathways, which enables rapid adaptation to changes in the intracellular environment.","Significance Control of glycolytic flux plays an important role in energy production and metabolic homeostasis in cells.

"Protein C inhibitor (PCI) is a heparin-binding serine proteinase inhibitor belonging to the family of serpin proteins. Here we describe that PCI exerts broad antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens. This ability is mediated by the interaction of PCI with lipid membranes, which subsequently leads to their permeabilization. As shown by negative staining electron microscopy, treatment of Escherichia coli or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria with PCI triggers membrane disruption followed by the efflux of bacterial cytosolic contents and bacterial killing. The antimicrobial activity of PCI is located to the heparin-binding site of the protein and a peptide spanning this region was found to mimic the antimicrobial activity of PCI, without causing lysis or membrane destruction of eukaryotic cells. Finally, we show that platelets can assemble PCI on their surface upon activation. As platelets are recruited to the site of a bacterial infection, these results may explain our finding that PCI levels are increased in tissue biopsies from patients suffering from necrotizing fasciitis caused by S. pyogenes. Taken together, our data describe a new function for PCI in innate immunity.","The innate immune system is an integral part of our battle against an invading pathogen. Antimicrobial peptides and proteins partake in this fight due to their ability to perforate the bacterial cell wall, which eventually will cause the efflux of bacterial cytosolic content and efficient bacterial killing.

Here we show that PCI is a potent antimicrobial agent that is able to destroy the bacterial cell wall and thereby cause death of the bacteria. Our study also shows that in contrast to many other antimicrobial peptides, processing of PCI is not required since the full length protein exerts its antimicrobial activity, and we present data demonstrating that PCI is enriched at the infected site of patients suffering from severe streptococcal infection.","protein C inhibitor (PCI) is a heparin-binding serine proteinase inhibitor belonging to the family of serpin proteins . it exerts broad antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens . this ability is mediated by the interaction of PCI with lipid membranes, which subsequently leads to their permeabilization . as shown by negative staining electron microscopy, treatment of Escherichia coli or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria with PCI triggers membrane disruption followed by the efflux of bacterial cytosolic contents and bacterial killing . we show that platelets can assemble PCI"
"Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial cell-to-cell communication process that relies on the production, release, and response to extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. QS controls virulence and biofilm formation in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa possesses two canonical LuxI/R-type QS systems, LasI/R and RhlI/R, which produce and detect 3OC12-homoserine lactone and C4-homoserine lactone, respectively. Here, we use biofilm analyses, reporter assays, RNA-seq studies, and animal infection assays to show that RhlR directs both RhlI-dependent and RhlI-independent regulons. In the absence of RhlI, RhlR controls the expression of genes required for biofilm formation as well as genes encoding virulence factors. Consistent with these findings, DrhlR and DrhlI mutants have radically different biofilm phenotypes and the DrhlI mutant displays full virulence in animals whereas the DrhlR mutant is attenuated. The DrhlI mutant cell-free culture fluids contain an activity that stimulates RhlR-dependent gene expression. We propose a model in which RhlR responds to an alternative ligand, in addition to its canonical C4-homoserine lactone autoinducer. This alternate ligand promotes a RhlR-dependent transcriptional program in the absence of RhlI.","Quorum sensing ( QS) is a cell-to-cell communication process that bacteria use to coordinate group behaviors. QS is essential for virulence and biofilm formation in many bacteria including the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa has high clinical relevance because it has acquired resistance to commonly used antibiotics, and is a priority pathogen on the CDC ESKAPE pathogen list. The urgent need for new antimicrobials to combat P. aeruginosa infections makes targeting QS for interference an attractive approach. Here, we investigate P. aeruginosa under biofilm conditions that mimic authentic P. aeruginosa lifestyles in environmental and medical contexts rather than in traditional laboratory conditions. This strategy enabled us to find that P. aeruginosa uses a novel QS signal molecule that controls biofilm formation and virulence. The new signal molecule acts together with the long-known QS receptor RhlR. Using physiologic, genetic, and molecular studies, combined with animal models of infection, we characterize the roles of QS components in biofilm formation and virulence. We find that RhlR and the putative new signal molecule are crucial for both traits. Our work suggests that targeting RhlR with small molecule inhibitors could provide an exciting path forward for the development of novel antimicrobials.","a bacterial cell-to-cell communication process relies on the production, release, and response to extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers .

"Innate immune cells like monocytes patrol the vasculature and mucosal surfaces, recognize pathogens, rapidly redistribute to affected tissues and cause inflammation by secretion of cytokines. We previously showed that monocytes are reduced in blood but accumulate in the airways of patients with Puumala virus (PUUV) caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) . However, the dynamics of monocyte infiltration to the kidneys during HFRS, and its impact on disease severity are currently unknown. Here, we examined longitudinal peripheral blood samples and renal biopsies from HFRS patients and performed in vitro experiments to investigate the fate of monocytes during HFRS. During the early stages of HFRS, circulating CD14-CD16+ nonclassical monocytes (NCMs) that patrol the vasculature were reduced in most patients. Instead, CD14+CD16- classical (CMs) and CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes (IMs) were increased in blood, in particular in HFRS patients with more severe disease. Blood monocytes from patients with acute HFRS expressed higher levels of HLA-DR, the endothelial adhesion marker CD62L and the chemokine receptors CCR7 and CCR2, as compared to convalescence, suggesting monocyte activation and migration to peripheral tissues during acute HFRS. Supporting this hypothesis, increased numbers of HLA-DR+, CD14+, CD16+ and CD68+ cells were observed in the renal tissues of acute HFRS patients compared to controls. In vitro, blood CD16+ monocytes upregulated CD62L after direct exposure to PUUV whereas CD16- monocytes upregulated CCR7 after contact with PUUV-infected endothelial cells, suggesting differential mechanisms of activation and response between monocyte subsets. Together, our findings suggest that NCMs are reduced in blood, potentially via CD62L-mediated attachment to endothelial cells and monocytes are recruited to the kidneys during HFRS. Monocyte mobilization, activation and functional impairment together may influence the severity of disease in acute PUUV-HFRS.","Hantaviruses are re-emerging human pathogens that can cause severe disease, typically manifesting in the lungs or kidneys. The virus preferentially infects the endothelial cells without killing them. Therefore, the vascular leakage associated with hantavirus disease, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS) is believed to be a consequence of the dysregulated immune response to infection. In the present study, in a cohort of PUUV-infected patients with acute HFRS, we describe a striking depletion of nonclassical monocytes from circulation while classical and intermediate monocyte frequencies are increased. Importantly, we found increased numbers of cells expressing monocyte and macrophage markers in the kidneys of patients with HFRS. The monocytes remaining in circulation show signs of activation, migration to the periphery and impairment in their ability to respond to TLR stimulation. Interestingly, the magnitude of monocyte activation was associated with greater disease severity. In addition, we also noted that different monocyte subsets differ in how they recognize and respond to cell-free or cell-associated hantavirus exposure. Collectively, our study greatly adds to what is currently known about how monocytes behave during human hantavirus disease, and highlights the importance of studying functional differences across the major monocyte subsets at greater resolution.","we previously showed that monocytes are reduced in blood but accumulate in the airways of patients with Puumala virus (PUUV) caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) . however, the dynamics of monocyte infiltration to the kidneys during HFRS, and its impact on disease severity are currently unknown . here , we examined longitudinal peripheral blood samples and renal biopsies from patients with acute PUUV-HFRS . circulating CD14-CD16+ nonclassical monocyte (NCMs) that patrol the vasculature were reduced in most patients whereas CD14+CD16- classical (CMs) and CD14"
"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is hypoendemic in the Mediterranean region, where it is caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum. An effective vaccine for humans is not yet available and the severe side-effects of the drugs in clinical use, linked to the parenteral administration route of most of them, are significant concerns of the current leishmanicidal medicines. New drugs are desperately needed to treat VL and phenotype-based High Throughput Screenings (HTS) appear to be suitable to achieve this goal in the coming years. We generated two infrared fluorescent L. infantum strains, which stably overexpress the IFP 1. 4 and iRFP reporter genes and performed comparative studies of their biophotonic properties at both promastigote and amastigote stages. To improve the fluorescence emission of the selected reporter in intracellular amastigotes, we engineered distinct constructs by introducing regulatory sequences of differentially-expressed genes (A2, AMASTIN and HSP70 II) . The final strain that carries the iRFP gene under the control of the L. infantum HSP70 II downstream region (DSR) , was employed to perform a phenotypic screening of a collection of small molecules by using ex vivo splenocytes from infrared-infected BALB/c mice. In order to further investigate the usefulness of this infrared strain, we monitored an in vivo infection by imaging BALB/c mice in a time-course study of 20 weeks. The near-infrared fluorescent L. infantum strain represents an important step forward in bioimaging research of VL, providing a robust model of phenotypic screening suitable for HTS of small molecule collections in the mammalian parasite stage. Additionally, HSP70 II+L. infantum strain permitted for the first time to monitor an in vivo infection of VL. This finding accelerates the possibility of testing new drugs in preclinical in vivo studies, thus supporting the urgent and challenging drug discovery program against this parasitic disease.","Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL) , caused by Leishmania infantum or L. donovani, is still one of the most threatening diseases affecting poor people in developing countries, with a fatality rate as high as 100% in two years in infected and untreated people. With no vaccine available and ineffective and toxic chemotherapy, the search for new potential drugs that accelerate the urgent drug discovery process are highly needed. A novel technology that addresses this important issue has been developed, by performing High Throughput Screening ( HTS) assays in 384-well plates format in combination with an infrared L. infantum-expressing strain. The system was further validated to identify active compounds against VL in an ex vivo splenic culture. In addition, in vivo non-invasive imaging of the visceral infection in BALB/c mice was achieved for the first time by using transgenic fluorescent parasites. These findings open up the possibility of testing vast amounts of potential compounds and allow in vivo screening of drug candidates against this severe parasitic disease in an attempt to speed up the vital drug discovery program.","visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is hypoendemic in the Mediterranean region , where it is caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum . phenotype-based high throughput screenings (HTS) appear to be suitable to achieve this goal in the coming years . we generated two infrared fluorescent L. infantum strains that stably overexpress the IFP 1. 4 and iRFP reporter genes and performed comparative studies of their biophotonic properties at both promastigote and amastigotes . this finding accelerates the possibility of testing new drugs in preclinical in vivo studies , thus"
"Humanity depends on biodiversity for health, well-being, and a stable environment. As biodiversity change accelerates, we are still discovering the full range of consequences for human health and well-being. Here, we test the hypothesis--derived from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory--that species richness and ecological functional diversity allow seafood diets to fulfill multiple nutritional requirements, a condition necessary for human health. We analyzed a newly synthesized dataset of 7, 245 observations of nutrient and contaminant concentrations in 801 aquatic animal taxa and found that species with different ecological traits have distinct and complementary micronutrient profiles but little difference in protein content. The same complementarity mechanisms that generate positive biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems also operate in seafood assemblages, allowing more diverse diets to yield increased nutritional benefits independent of total biomass consumed. Notably, nutritional metrics that capture multiple micronutrients and fatty acids essential for human well-being depend more strongly on biodiversity than common ecological measures of function such as productivity, typically reported for grasslands and forests. Furthermore, we found that increasing species richness did not increase the amount of protein in seafood diets and also increased concentrations of toxic metal contaminants in the diet. Seafood-derived micronutrients and fatty acids are important for human health and are a pillar of global food and nutrition security. By drawing upon biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, we demonstrate that ecological concepts of biodiversity can deepen our understanding of nature's benefits to people and unite sustainability goals for biodiversity and human well-being.","Significance Food security is not simply about maintaining yields, but it is also about the need for a stable supply of nutritionally diverse foods. Obtaining nutritious food is a major challenge facing humanity, and diverse aquatic ecosystems can help meet this goal. To test how aquatic biodiversity affects human health, we assembled a dataset of nutrients, contaminants, and ecological traits of 801 aquatic species. We used ecological models to quantify the role of species richness and ecological functional diversity and found that these biodiversity dimensions enhanced seafood micronutrient and fatty acid provisioning by the same mechanisms that link biodiversity to productivity in grasslands, forests, and other systems. Our results underscore the need to minimize aquatic biodiversity loss to sustain and improve human well-being.","we test the hypothesis--derived from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory--that species richness and ecological functional diversity allow seafood diets to fulfill multiple nutritional requirements, a condition necessary for human health . we analyzed a newly synthesized dataset of 7, 245 observations of nutrient and contaminant concentrations in 801 aquatic animal taxa and found that species with different ecological traits have distinct and complementary micronutrient profiles but little difference in protein content . the same complementarity mechanisms that generate positive biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems also operate in seafood assemblages , allowing more diverse foods to yield increased nutritional benefits independent of total biomass consumed . here, we demonstrate that"
"Anthropogenic noise is a pervasive pollutant that decreases environmental quality by disrupting a suite of behaviors vital to perception and communication. However, even within populations of noise-sensitive species, individuals still select breeding sites located within areas exposed to high noise levels, with largely unknown physiological and fitness consequences. We use a study system in the natural gas fields of northern New Mexico to test the prediction that exposure to noise causes glucocorticoid-signaling dysfunction and decreases fitness in a community of secondary cavity-nesting birds. In accordance with these predictions, and across all species, we find strong support for noise exposure decreasing baseline corticosterone in adults and nestlings and, conversely, increasing acute stressor-induced corticosterone in nestlings. We also document fitness consequences with increased noise in the form of reduced hatching success in the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana) , the species most likely to nest in noisiest environments. Nestlings of all three species exhibited accelerated growth of both feathers and body size at intermediate noise amplitudes compared with lower or higher amplitudes. Our results are consistent with recent experimental laboratory studies and show that noise functions as a chronic, inescapable stressor. Anthropogenic noise likely impairs environmental risk perception by species relying on acoustic cues and ultimately leads to impacts on fitness. Our work, when taken together with recent efforts to document noise across the landscape, implies potential widespread, noise-induced chronic stress coupled with reduced fitness for many species reliant on acoustic cues.","Significance Studies examining relationships among habitat disturbance, physiology, and fitness in wild animals often produce contradictory or inconclusive results, casting doubt on current conservation physiology predictive frameworks linking stress and fitness. We apply a new framework drawn from experimental systems utilizing chronic inescapable stressors to explore how noise, an environmental stimulus common to wildlife habitats worldwide, disrupts stress hormone signaling and impacts fitness. We utilize a natural experiment to show that chronic, anthropogenic noise reduced baseline corticosterone levels, increased acute corticosterone response, and, at highest amplitudes, negatively impacted multiple measures of fitness across three species of birds. Our work brings conservation physiology theory involving wild animals into needed alignment with recent theories based on chronic stress in laboratory studies.","anthropogenic noise is a pervasive pollutant that decreases environmental quality by disrupting a suite of behaviors vital to perception and communication . however, even within populations of noise-sensitive species, individuals still select breeding sites located within areas exposed to high noise levels , with largely unknown physiological and fitness consequences . in accordance with these predictions, and across all species, we find strong support for noise exposure decreasing baseline corticosterone in adults and nestlings and, conversely, increasing acute stressor-induced corticostone in a community of secondary cavity-nesting birds . we also document fitness consequences with increased noise in the form of reduced hatching success in the"
"Direct conversion of carbon dioxide to multicarbon products remains as a grand challenge in electrochemical CO2 reduction. Various forms of oxidized copper have been demonstrated as electrocatalysts that still require large overpotentials. Here, we show that an ensemble of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) enables selective formation of C2-C3 products at low overpotentials. Densely packed Cu NP ensembles underwent structural transformation during electrolysis into electrocatalytically active cube-like particles intermixed with smaller nanoparticles. Ethylene, ethanol, and n-propanol are the major C2-C3 products with onset potential at -0. 53 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and C2-C3 faradaic efficiency (FE) reaching 50% at only -0. 75 V. Thus, the catalyst exhibits selective generation of C2-C3 hydrocarbons and oxygenates at considerably lowered overpotentials in neutral pH aqueous media. In addition, this approach suggests new opportunities in realizing multicarbon product formation from CO2, where the majority of efforts has been to use oxidized copper-based materials. Robust catalytic performance is demonstrated by 10 h of stable operation with C2-C3 current density 10 mA/cm^2 (at -0. 75 V) , rendering it attractive for solar-to-fuel applications. Tafel analysis suggests reductive CO coupling as a rate determining step for C2 products, while n-propanol (C3) production seems to have a discrete pathway.","Significance Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to carbon-based products, which can be used directly as fuels or indirectly as fuel precursors, is suggested as one of the promising solutions for sustainability. Not only does this process allow using renewables such as solar electricity as energy input, but CO2 emitted from the consumption process can be recycled back into fuels. The success of this technology depends on the value added to the product that forms from CO2, and therefore it is important to facilitate multicarbon product generation. This work presents a copper-based catalyst, formed in situ from an ensemble of nanoparticles, that is able to selectively generate C2-C3 products at low overpotentials with good stability, where their efficient formation has been difficult to achieve.","we show that an ensemble of Cu nanoparticles ( NPs) enables selective formation of C2-C3 products at low overpotentials . the catalyst exhibits selective generation of n-propanol (C3) hydrocarbons and oxygenates at considerably lowered onset potential at -0. 75 V , rendering it attractive for solar-to-fuel applications . this approach suggests new opportunities in realizing multicarbon product formation from CO2 where the majority of efforts has been to use oxidized copper-based materials ."
"Paramutations represent heritable epigenetic alterations that cause departures from Mendelian inheritance. While the mechanism responsible is largely unknown, recent results in both mouse and maize suggest paramutations are correlated with RNA molecules capable of affecting changes in gene expression patterns. In maize, multiple required to maintain repression (rmr) loci stabilize these paramutant states. Here we show rmr1 encodes a novel Snf2 protein that affects both small RNA accumulation and cytosine methylation of a proximal transposon fragment at the Pl1-Rhoades allele. However, these cytosine methylation differences do not define the various epigenetic states associated with paramutations. Pedigree analyses also show RMR1 does not mediate the allelic interactions that typically establish paramutations. Strikingly, our mutant analyses show that Pl1-Rhoades RNA transcript levels are altered independently of transcription rates, implicating a post-transcriptional level of RMR1 action. These results suggest the RNA component of maize paramutation maintains small heterochromatic-like domains that can affect, via the activity of a Snf2 protein, the stability of nascent transcripts from adjacent genes by way of a cotranscriptional repression process. These findings highlight a mechanism by which alleles of endogenous loci can acquire novel expression patterns that are meiotically transmissible.","Genetics is founded on the principle that heritable changes in genes are caused by mutations and that the regulatory state of gene pairs ( alleles) is passed on to progeny unchanged. An exception to this rule, paramutations--which reflect the outcome of interactions between alleles--produce changes in gene control that are stably inherited without altering the DNA sequence. It is currently thought that these allelic interactions cause structural alterations to the chromatin surrounding the gene. Recent work in both maize and mice suggests that RNA molecules may be responsible for paramutations. Several genes are required to maintain the repressed paramutant state of a maize purple plant1 ( pl1) allele, and here we report that one of these genes encodes a protein ( RMR1) with similarity to a protein previously implicated in facilitating genomic DNA modifications via small RNA molecules. Genetic and molecular experiments support a similar role for RMR1 acting at a repeated sequence found adjacent to this pl1 gene. Although loss of these DNA modifications leads to heritable changes in gene regulation, the data indicate these changes do not represent the heritable feature responsible for paramutation. These findings highlight an unusual but dynamic role for repeated genomic features and small RNA molecules in affecting heritable genetic changes independent of the DNA template.","multiple required to maintain repression (rmr)1 encodes a novel Snf2 protein that affects both small RNA accumulation and cytosine methylation of a proximal transposon fragment at the Pl1-Rhoades allele . however, these differences do not define the various epigenetic states associated with these paramutant states . here we show that the RNA component of maize paramutation maintains small heterochromatic-like domains that can affect the stability of nascent transcripts from adjacent genes through a cotranscriptional repressive process . these findings highlight a mechanism by which allele"
"Nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) to treat human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) , commonly called sleeping sickness, was added to the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Essential Medicines List in 2009 and to the Paediatric List in 2012. NECT was further tested and documented in a phase IIIb clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) assessing the safety, effectiveness, and feasibility of implementation under field conditions (NECT-FIELD study) . This trial brought a unique possibility to examine concomitant drug management. This is a secondary analysis of the NECT-FIELD study where 629 second stage gambiense HAT patients were treated with NECT, including children and pregnant and breastfeeding women in six general reference hospitals located in two provinces. Concomitant drugs were prescribed by the local investigators as needed. Patients underwent daily evaluations, including vital signs, physical examination, and adverse event monitoring. Concomitant medication was documented from admission to discharge. Patients' clinical profiles on admission and safety profile during specific HAT treatment were similar to previously published reports. Prescribed concomitant medications administered during the hospitalization period, before, during, and immediately after NECT treatment, were mainly analgesics/antipyretics, anthelmintics, antimalarials, antiemetics, and sedatives. Use of antibiotics was reasonable and antibiotics were often prescribed to treat cellulitis and respiratory tract infections. Prevention and treatment of neurological conditions such as convulsions, loss of consciousness, and coma was used in approximately 5% of patients. The prescription of concomitant treatments was coherent with the clinical and safety profile of the patients. However, some prescription habits would need to be adapted in the future to the evolving available pharmacopoeia. A list of minimal essential medication that should be available at no cost to patients in treatment wards is proposed to help the different actors to plan, manage, and adequately fund drug supplies for advanced HAT infected patients. The initial study was registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00906880.","Sleeping sickness is a neglected tropical disease caused by a parasite, the trypanosome, transmitted by the tse-tse fly. It affects people in Sub-Saharan Africa, most of them living in poor rural settings with limited access to healthcare. If the disease remains untreated, it usually progresses from a haemo-lymphatic invasion into a second stage or neuro-encephalitic infection evolving into coma and death. When these second stage patients are referred to treatment centres, the disease is often advanced. Therefore, on top of sleeping sickness treatment, additional care and medications are regularly required. We report here the concomitant medications that were prescribed to second stage sleeping sickness patients, including vulnerable populations such as children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women, in the context of a phase IIIb trial assessing the safety, effectiveness, and feasibility of implementation of the Nifurtimox Eflornithine Combination Therapy ( NECT) in field conditions.

"A typical Go/No-Go decision is suggested to be implemented in the brain via the activation of the direct or indirect pathway in the basal ganglia. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum, receiving input from cortex and projecting to the direct and indirect pathways express D1 and D2 type dopamine receptors, respectively. Recently, it has become clear that the two types of MSNs markedly differ in their mutual and recurrent connectivities as well as feedforward inhibition from FSIs. Therefore, to understand striatal function in action selection, it is of key importance to identify the role of the distinct connectivities within and between the two types of MSNs on the balance of their activity. Here, we used both a reduced firing rate model and numerical simulations of a spiking network model of the striatum to analyze the dynamic balance of spiking activities in D1 and D2 MSNs. We show that the asymmetric connectivity of the two types of MSNs renders the striatum into a threshold device, indicating the state of cortical input rates and correlations by the relative activity rates of D1 and D2 MSNs. Next, we describe how this striatal threshold can be effectively modulated by the activity of fast spiking interneurons, by the dopamine level, and by the activity of the GPe via pallidostriatal backprojections. We show that multiple mechanisms exist in the basal ganglia for biasing striatal output in favour of either the `Go' or the `No-Go' pathway. This new understanding of striatal network dynamics provides novel insights into the putative role of the striatum in various behavioral deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease, including increased reaction times, L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia, and deep brain stimulation-induced impulsivity.","The basal ganglia ( BG) play a crucial role in a variety of cognitive and motor functions. BG dysfunction leads to brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease. At the main input stage of the BG, the striatum, two competing pathways originate. Neurons projecting on these pathways either express D1 or D2 type dopamine receptors. Because activity of D1 or D2 neurons facilitate go or no-go type decision, it is important to study the balance of the D1 and D2 neuron activity. Contrary to the common assumption thus far, recent data shows an asymmetry in striatal circuit with D1 receiving higher inhibition from D2 and fast-spiking neurons. Here, we studied the functional implications of the asymmetric connectivity between D1 and D2 neurons. Our analysis and simulations show that the asymmetric connectivity between these neurons gives rise to a decision transition threshold ( DTT) , as a consequence D1 ( D2) neurons have higher firing rate at lower ( higher) average cortical firing rates. Importantly, DTT can be modulated by input correlations, local connectivity, feedforward inhibition and dopamine. Our results suggest that abnormal changes in the DTT could be a plausible mechanism underlying the cognitive and motor deficits associated with brain diseases involving BG malfunction.","striatal network dynamics provide novel insights into the putative role of the striatum in various behavioral deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease , including increased reaction times , L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia , and deep brain stimulation-induced impulsivity . here, we used both a reduced firing rate model and numerical simulations of a spiking network model of the basal ganglia to analyze the dynamic balance of spirking activities in D1 and D2 MSNs . we show that the asymmetric connectivity of the two types of MSN is a threshold device , indicating the state of cortical input rates"
"Gene expression data has been used in lieu of phenotype in both classical and quantitative genetic settings. These two disciplines have separate approaches to measuring and interpreting epistasis, which is the interaction between alleles at different loci. We propose a framework for estimating and interpreting epistasis from a classical experiment that combines the strengths of each approach. A regression analysis step accommodates the quantitative nature of expression measurements by estimating the effect of gene deletions plus any interaction. Effects are selected by significance such that a reduced model describes each expression trait. We show how the resulting models correspond to specific hierarchical relationships between two regulator genes and a target gene. These relationships are the basic units of genetic pathways and genomic system diagrams. Our approach can be extended to analyze data from a variety of experiments, multiple loci, and multiple environments.","Epistasis has long had two slightly different meanings depending on the context in which it is discussed. The classical definition describes an allele at one locus completely masking the effect of an allele at a second locus. Such relationships can be interpreted as hierarchical, and they can be combined to infer genetic pathways. In quantitative genetics, epistasis encompasses a wide range of interactions and can be extended to more than two loci. These two definitions coexist because they are typically applied to different types of study populations and different types of traits. The current trend is to treat gene expression as a trait in a variety of genetic backgrounds. This provides reason to revisit epistasis in this new context. We accommodate the continuous nature of gene expression using ideas from quantitative genetics, but retain the hierarchical interpretation of the classical experiment. These hierarchical relationships are the building blocks of systems diagrams and genetic pathways.

"Mobile group II introns consist of a catalytic intron RNA and an intron-encoded protein with reverse transcriptase activity, which act together in a ribonucleoprotein particle to promote DNA integration during intron mobility. Previously, we found that the Lactococcus lactis Ll. LtrB intron-encoded protein (LtrA) expressed alone or with the intron RNA to form ribonucleoprotein particles localizes to bacterial cellular poles, potentially accounting for the intron's preferential insertion in the oriC and ter regions of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Here, by using cell microarrays and automated fluorescence microscopy to screen a transposon-insertion library, we identified five E. coli genes (gppA, uhpT, wcaK, ynbC, and zntR) whose disruption results in both an increased proportion of cells with more diffuse LtrA localization and a more uniform genomic distribution of Ll. LtrB-insertion sites. Surprisingly, we find that a common factor affecting LtrA localization in these and other disruptants is the accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate, which appears to bind LtrA and other basic proteins and delocalize them away from the poles. Our findings show that the intracellular localization of a group II intron-encoded protein is a major determinant of insertion-site preference. More generally, our results suggest that polyphosphate accumulation may provide a means of localizing proteins to different sites of action during cellular stress or entry into stationary phase, with potentially wide physiological consequences.","Group II introns are bacterial mobile elements thought to be ancestors of introns--genetic material that is discarded from messenger RNA transcripts--and retroelements--genetic elements and viruses that replicate via reverse transcription--in higher organisms.

"Over the course of the aging process, fibroblasts lose contractility, leading to reduced connective-tissue stiffness. A promising therapeutic avenue for functional rejuvenation of connective tissue is reprogrammed fibroblast replacement, although major hurdles still remain. Toward this, we recently demonstrated that the laterally confined growth of fibroblasts on micropatterned substrates induces stem-cell-like spheroids. In this study, we embedded these partially reprogrammed spheroids in collagen-I matrices of varying densities, mimicking different three-dimensional (3D) tissue constraints. In response to such matrix constraints, these spheroids regained their fibroblastic properties and sprouted to form 3D connective-tissue networks. Interestingly, we found that these differentiated fibroblasts exhibit reduced DNA damage, enhanced cytoskeletal gene expression, and actomyosin contractility. In addition, the rejuvenated fibroblasts show increased matrix protein (fibronectin and laminin) deposition and collagen remodeling compared to the parental fibroblast tissue network. Furthermore, we show that the partially reprogrammed cells have comparatively open chromatin compaction states and may be more poised to redifferentiate into contractile fibroblasts in 3D-collagen matrix. Collectively, our results highlight efficient fibroblast rejuvenation through laterally confined reprogramming, which has important implications in regenerative medicine.","Significance The mechanical reprogramming of fibroblasts, followed by their redifferentiation into rejuvenated fibroblasts in an optimized 3D collagen matrix, made these cells more contractile and more efficient at synthesizing matrix components including laminin, fibronectin, and collagen-IV.

"Valentine and Moores [Valentine JW, Moores EM (1970) Nature 228: 657-659] hypothesized that plate tectonics regulates global biodiversity by changing the geographic arrangement of continental crust, but the data required to fully test the hypothesis were not available. Here, we use a global database of marine animal fossil occurrences and a paleogeographic reconstruction model to test the hypothesis that temporal patterns of continental fragmentation have impacted global Phanerozoic biodiversity. We find a positive correlation between global marine invertebrate genus richness and an independently derived quantitative index describing the fragmentation of continental crust during supercontinental coalescence-breakup cycles. The observed positive correlation between global biodiversity and continental fragmentation is not readily attributable to commonly cited vagaries of the fossil record, including changing quantities of marine rock or time-variable sampling effort. Because many different environmental and biotic factors may covary with changes in the geographic arrangement of continental crust, it is difficult to identify a specific causal mechanism. However, cross-correlation indicates that the state of continental fragmentation at a given time is positively correlated with the state of global biodiversity for tens of millions of years afterward. There is also evidence to suggest that continental fragmentation promotes increasing marine richness, but that coalescence alone has only a small negative or stabilizing effect. Together, these results suggest that continental fragmentation, particularly during the Mesozoic breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, has exerted a first-order control on the long-term trajectory of Phanerozoic marine animal diversity.",Significance Understanding the processes that govern biodiversity is a central goal of biology. It has been hypothesized that global biodiversity is influenced by tectonically driven shifts in the arrangement of continental crust. We use globally distributed fossil data and quantitative analyses of shifting continental configurations in paleogeographic reconstructions to test this hypothesis. A significant component of the trajectory of marine animal diversity over the past 443 million years is attributable to the assembly and disassembly of the supercontinent Pangaea.,"we find a positive correlation between global marine invertebrate genus richness and an independently derived quantitative index describing the fragmentation of continental crust during supercontinental coalescence-breakup cycles . here, we use a global database of marine animal fossil occurrences and a paleogeographic reconstruction model to test the hypothesis that temporal patterns of continental fragmentation have impacted global Phanerozoic biodiversity ."
"The Frank-Starling law of the heart is a physiological phenomenon that describes an intrinsic property of heart muscle in which increased cardiac filling leads to enhanced cardiac contractility. Identified more than a century ago, the Frank-Starling relationship is currently known to involve length-dependent enhancement of cardiac myofilament Ca^2+ sensitivity. However, the upstream molecular events that link cellular stretch to the length-dependent myofilament Ca^2+ sensitivity are poorly understood. Because the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the multifunctional transducer protein b-arrestin have been shown to mediate mechanosensitive cellular signaling, we tested the hypothesis that these two proteins are involved in the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart. Using invasive hemodynamics, we found that mice lacking b-arrestin 1, b-arrestin 2, or AT1R were unable to generate a Frank-Starling force in response to changes in cardiac volume. Although wild-type mice pretreated with the conventional AT1R blocker losartan were unable to enhance cardiac contractility with volume loading, treatment with a b-arrestin-biased AT1R ligand to selectively activate b-arrestin signaling preserved the Frank-Starling relationship. Importantly, in skinned muscle fiber preparations, we found markedly impaired length-dependent myofilament Ca^2+ sensitivity in b-arrestin 1, b-arrestin 2, and AT1R knockout mice. Our data reveal b-arrestin 1, b-arrestin 2, and AT1R as key regulatory molecules in the Frank-Starling mechanism, which potentially can be targeted therapeutically with b-arrestin-biased AT1R ligands.","Significance The Frank-Starling law of the heart describes the heart's ability to enhance contractility in response to increased cardiac filling. This property is fundamental to how humans maintain cardiovascular function in response to changes in circulating blood volume, and is regulated by enhanced calcium sensitivity of myofilaments with biomechanical stretch. The mechanism of how biomechanical stretch leads to changes in the myofilament calcium sensitivity remains poorly understood. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that b-arrestin and the angiotensin II type I receptor act as crucial molecular regulators of the Frank-Starling law of the heart. This work identifies b-arrestins as important regulators of this fundamental principle of cardiac contractility.","the Frank-Starling law of the heart is a physiological phenomenon that describes an intrinsic property of heart muscle in which increased cardiac filling leads to enhanced cardiac contractility . however, the upstream molecular events that link cellular stretch to the length-dependent myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity are poorly understood . because the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the multifunctional transducer protein b-arrestin have been shown to mediate mechanosensitive cellular signaling , we tested the hypothesis that these two proteins are involved in the Frank --starling mechanism . invasive hemodynamics revealed that mice lacking "
"While the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activates a general stress response by increasing glucocorticoid (Gc) synthesis, biological stress resulting from infections triggers the inflammatory response through production of cytokines. The pituitary gland integrates some of these signals by responding to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and LIF and to a negative Gc feedback loop. The present work used whole-genome approaches to define the LIF/STAT3 regulatory network and to delineate cross-talk between this pathway and Gc action. Genome-wide ChIP-chip identified 3, 449 STAT3 binding sites, whereas 2, 396 genes regulated by LIF and/or Gc were found by expression profiling. Surprisingly, LIF on its own changed expression of only 85 genes but the joint action of LIF and Gc potentiated the expression of more than a thousand genes. Accordingly, activation of both LIF and Gc pathways also potentiated STAT3 and GR recruitment to many STAT3 targets. Our analyses revealed an unexpected gene cluster that requires both stimuli for delayed activation; 83% of the genes in this cluster are involved in different cell defense mechanisms. Thus, stressors that trigger both general stress and inflammatory responses lead to activation of a stereotypic innate cellular defense response.","Global biological responses involve pleiotropic, general components exhibited by many cells/tissues together with cell-specific responses. Typically, such responses are dependent on multiple signaling pathways that integrate different inputs to trigger concerted tissue/cell responses. In studying LIF action in the context of immune-endocrine regulatory interactions, we found that LIF regulates expression of a surprisingly small number of genes. In contrast, the mapping of LIF-activated STAT3 transcription factor recruitment by genome-wide ChIP-chip led to the identification of a much larger set of putative regulatory sites. In view of the cross-talk between cytokine and glucocorticoid ( Gc) signaling in response to stress and inflammation, we investigated the contribution of Gc to LIF action. Interestingly, the discrepancy between the number of LIF-regulated genes and LIF-dependent STAT3 genomic targets was partly explained by widespread Gc potentiation of LIF action. We further show requirement on both signaling pathways to elicit a pleiotropic and stereotypic innate cellular defense response, together with cell-specific responses such as antagonism between cytokines and Gc on expression of pituitary POMC. Thus, this stereotypic innate cell defense response is defined by the convergence of pathways activated by the stress and inflammatory systems.","the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activates a general stress response by increasing glucocorticoid (Gc) synthesis , biological stress resulting from infections triggers the inflammatory response through production of cytokines . however , the pituitarian gland integrates some of these signals by responding to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and LIF and to a negative Gc feedback loop . the present work used whole-genome approaches to define the LIF/STAT3 regulatory network and to delineate cross-talk between this pathway and Gc action ."
"Identifying the drivers and processes that determine globally the geographic range size of species is crucial to understanding the geographic distribution of biodiversity and further predicting the response of species to current global changes. However, these drivers and processes are still poorly understood, and no ecological explanation has emerged yet as preponderant in explaining the extent of species' geographical range. Here, we identify the main drivers of the geographic range size variation in freshwater fishes at global and biogeographic scales and determine how these drivers affect range size both directly and indirectly. We tested the main hypotheses already proposed to explain range size variation, using geographic ranges of 8, 147 strictly freshwater fish species (i. e. , 63% of all known species) . We found that, contrary to terrestrial organisms, for which climate and topography seem preponderant in determining species' range size, the geographic range sizes of freshwater fishes are mostly explained by the species' position within the river network, and by the historical connection among river basins during Quaternary low-sea-level periods. Large-ranged fish species inhabit preferentially lowland areas of river basins, where hydrological connectivity is the highest, and also are found in river basins that were historically connected. The disproportionately high explanatory power of these two drivers suggests that connectivity is the key component of riverine fish geographic range sizes, independent of any other potential driver, and indicates that the accelerated rates in river fragmentation might strongly affect fish species distribution and freshwater biodiversity.","Significance Species' geographic range size is a fundamental aspect of understanding and predicting changes in biodiversity patterns. Investigating the global drivers of geographic range size variation in freshwater fishes, we found clear evidence that current and historical connectivity are, by far, the main determinants of range size. More specifically, we found that, everything else being equal, species displaying basal position in the drainage network ( i. e. , lowland areas) and found in drainage basins that have had connections during Quaternary low-sea-level periods have larger range sizes than their counterparts. Our findings suggest that connectivity is the key component of riverine fish geographic range sizes. This may have important implications for evaluating the vulnerability of freshwater species to river fragmentation.","identifying the drivers and processes that determine global the geographic range size of species is crucial to understanding the geographic distribution of biodiversity and further predicting the response of species to current global changes is still poorly understood . however , these drivers and process are still poor understood , and no ecological explanation has emerged yet as preponderant in explaining the extent of species' geographical range . here we identify the main drivers of the geographical range size variation in freshwater fishes at global and biogeographic scales and determine how these drivers affect range size both directly and indirectly . we tested the main hypotheses already proposed to explain range size variations using geographic ranges of 8, 147 strictly freshwater species (i. e"
"Background Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia, despite being considered not to be effective. Objectives To assess the analgesic efficacy, tolerability (drop-out due to adverse events), and safety (serious adverse events) of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for fibromyalgia in adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from inception to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries. Selection criteria We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing any oral NSAID with placebo or another active treatment for relief of pain in fibromyalgia, with subjective pain assessment by the participant. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)) or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC), serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events; secondary outcomes were adverse events, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and outcomes relating to sleep, fatigue, and quality of life. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results Our searches identified six randomised, double-blind studies involving 292 participants in suitably characterised fibromyalgia. The mean age of participants was between 39 and 50 years, and 89% to 100% were women. The initial pain intensity was around 7/10 on a 0 to 10 pain scale, indicating severe pain. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. The duration of treatment in the double-blind phase varied between three and eight weeks. Not all studies reported all the outcomes of interest. Analyses consistently showed no significant difference between NSAID and placebo: substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction) (risk difference (RD) -0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.04) 2 studies, 146 participants; moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction) (RD -0.04 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.08) 3 studies, 192 participants; withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.09) 4 studies, 230 participants; participants experiencing any adverse event (RD 0.08 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.19) 4 studies, 230 participants; all-cause withdrawals (RD 0.03 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.14) 3 studies, 192 participants. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. Although most studies had some measures of health-related quality of life, fibromyalgia impact, or other outcomes, none reported the outcomes beyond saying that there was no or little difference between the treatment groups. We downgraded evidence on all outcomes to very low quality, meaning that this research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect could be substantially different is very high. This is based on the small numbers of studies, participants, and events, as well as other deficiencies of reporting study quality allowing possible risks of bias. Authors' conclusions There is only a modest amount of very low-quality evidence about the use of NSAIDs in fibromyalgia, and that comes from small, largely inadequate studies with potential risk of bias. That bias would normally be to increase the apparent benefits of NSAIDs, but no such benefits were seen. Consequently, NSAIDs cannot be regarded as useful for treating fibromyalgia.","Oral NSAIDs for treating fibromyalgia pain in adults Bottom line We found very low-quality evidence that oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have no effect on pain or other symptoms in people with moderate or severe pain from fibromyalgia. Ibuprofen and diclofenac are common NSAIDs. Background Fibromyalgia is characterised by persistent, widespread pain, sleep problems, and fatigue. NSAIDs are drugs with analgesic (pain-killing), antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects, and also with anti-inflammatory effects at higher doses. NSAIDs are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Our definition of a good result was someone who had a high level of pain relief and was able to keep taking the medicine without side effects that made them want to stop. Study characteristics We searched for clinical trials in which NSAIDs were used to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. The latest search was in January 2017. Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, randomising 292 participants to treatment with NSAID or placebo. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. Study duration was between three and eight weeks. Not all studies reported the outcomes of interest. Key results We found no difference between NSAID or placebo for a range of outcomes. Pain reduction by half or better was experienced by 1 in 10 with NSAID and 2 in 10 with placebo. Pain reduction by a third or better was experienced by about 2 in 10 with both NSAID and placebo. Side effects were experienced by 3 in 10 with NSAID and 2 in 10 with placebo. Quality of the evidence The evidence was of very low quality. This means that the research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The chance that the real effect of NSAIDs could be substantially different is very high. Small studies like those in this review tend to overestimate results of treatment compared to the effects found in larger, better studies. The very low-quality evidence and the lack of any obvious benefit mean that NSAIDs cannot be regarded as useful for the management of fibromyalgia.","background Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia , despite being considered not to be effective .

"The Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding proteins (G3BP) are essential regulators of the formation of stress granules (SG) , cytosolic aggregates of proteins and RNA that are induced upon cellular stress, such as virus infection. Many viruses, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV) , block SG induction by targeting G3BP. In this work, we demonstrate that the G3BP-binding motif of SFV nsP3 consists of two FGDF motifs, in which both phenylalanine and the glycine residue are essential for binding. In addition, we show that binding of the cellular G3BP-binding partner USP10 is also mediated by an FGDF motif. Overexpression of wt USP10, but not a mutant lacking the FGDF-motif, blocks SG assembly. Further, we identified FGDF-mediated G3BP binding site in herpes simplex virus (HSV) protein ICP8, and show that ICP8 binding to G3BP also inhibits SG formation, which is a novel function of HSV ICP8. We present a model of the three-dimensional structure of G3BP bound to an FGDF-containing peptide, likely representing a binding mode shared by many proteins to target G3BP.","Stress granules ( SGs) are dynamic aggregates of proteins and translationally silenced mRNA that are formed in cells upon various stress conditions, such as virus infection. SGs are thought to be antiviral, and many viruses have hence evolved countermeasures to prevent their formation, often targeting the essential SG protein G3BP. Here, we show that several otherwise unrelated viral and cellular proteins all bind G3BP with the sequence motif FGDF, and thereby repress SG formation: the non-structural protein 3 ( nsP3) of the Old World alphavirus Semliki Forest virus ( a close relative of the emerging, highly pathogenic Chikungunya virus) ; the protein ICP8 of herpes simplex virus; and in addition, the cellular protein USP10 ( an SG component and protein deubiquitinase that stabilises e. g. the tumor suppressor p53) . In this work, we also present and validate a model of the three-dimensional structure of G3BP bound to an FGDF-containing peptide. The FGDF-mediated G3BP binding represents an attractive target for therapeutic interventions against a range of diverse viral infections, and may also regulate the p53-stabilising function of USP10 in cancers.","the Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding proteins (G3BP) are essential regulators of the formation of stress granules (SG) , cytosolic aggregates of proteins and RNA that are induced upon cellular stress . many viruses block SG induction by targeting G3BP . in this work , we demonstrate that the FGDF-mediated binding site in herpes simplex virus (HSV) protein ICP8 blocks SG formation , which is a novel function of HSV ICP8, and show that binding of wt USP10 is also mediated by a mutant lacking the glycine residue are essential for"
"During HIV-1 fusion to the host cell membrane, the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) of the envelope subunit gp41 become transiently exposed and accessible to fusion inhibitors or Abs. In this process, the NHR region adopts a trimeric coiled-coil conformation that can be a target for therapeutic intervention. Here, we present an approach to rationally design single-chain protein constructs that mimic the NHR coiled-coil surface. The proteins were built by connecting with short loops two parallel NHR helices and an antiparallel one with the inverse sequence followed by engineering of stabilizing interactions. The constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified with high yield, and folded as highly stable helical coiled coils. The crystal structure of one of the constructs confirmed the predicted fold and its ability to accurately mimic an exposed gp41 NHR surface. These single-chain proteins bound to synthetic CHR peptides with very high affinity, and furthermore, they showed broad inhibitory activity of HIV-1 fusion on various pseudoviruses and primary isolates.","Significance The envelope subunit gp41 is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention against HIV-1.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the detection limit of 3 PCR approaches. We determined the detection limit of 3 different PCR approaches: Bartonella-specific 16S rRNA, fla and its genes. We also evaluated the viability of dry blood spots to be used as a sample transport system. Our results show that 16S rRNA PCR is the approach with a lowest detection limit, 5 CFU/mL, and thus, the best diagnostic PCR tool studied. Dry blood spots diminish the sensitivity of the assay.

However its use in samples from dry blood spots results in easier management of transport samples in rural areas, a slight decrease in the sensitivity was observed.

"Spatial biological networks are abundant on all scales of life, from single cells to ecosystems, and perform various important functions including signal transmission and nutrient transport. These biological functions depend on the architecture of the network, which emerges as the result of a dynamic, feedback-driven developmental process. While cell behavior during growth can be genetically encoded, the resulting network structure depends on spatial constraints and tissue architecture. Since network growth is often difficult to observe experimentally, computer simulations can help to understand how local cell behavior determines the resulting network architecture. We present here a computational framework based on directional statistics to model network formation in space and time under arbitrary spatial constraints. Growth is described as a biased correlated random walk where direction and branching depend on the local environmental conditions and constraints, which are presented as 3D multilayer grid. To demonstrate the application of our tool, we perform growth simulations of a dense network between cells and compare the results to experimental data from osteocyte networks in bone.

"Background Young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have impairments in the areas of communication and social interaction and often display repetitive or non-compliant behaviour. This early pattern of difficulties is a challenge for parents. Therefore, approaches that help parents develop strategies for interaction and management of behaviour are an obvious route for early intervention in ASD. This review updates a Cochrane review first published in 2002 but is based on a new protocol. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of parent-mediated early interventions in terms of the benefits for both children with ASD and their parents and to explore some potential moderators of treatment effect. Search methods We searched a range of psychological, educational and biomedical databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and ERIC in August 2012. As this is an update of a previous review, we limited the search to the period following the original searches in 2002. Bibliographies and reference lists of key articles were searched, field experts were contacted and key journals were handsearched. Selection criteria We included only randomised controlled trials of early intervention for children with ASD. The interventions in the experimental condition were mediated by parents; the control conditions included no treatment, treatment as usual, waiting list, alternative child-centred intervention not mediated by parents, or alternative parent-mediated intervention of hypothesised lesser effect than the experimental condition. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (HM and IPO) independently screened articles identified in the search and decided which articles should be retrieved in full. For each included study, two review authors (IPO and EH) extracted and recorded data, using a piloted data collection form. Two review authors (IPO and HM) assessed the risk of bias in each study. We performed data synthesis and analysis using The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.1 software. Main results The review includes 17 studies from six countries (USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Thailand and China), which recruited 919 children with ASD. Not all 17 studies could be compared directly or combined in meta-analyses due to differences in the theoretical basis underpinning interventions, the duration and intensity of interventions, and the outcome measurement tools used. Data from subsets of 10 studies that evaluated interventions to enhance parent interaction style and thereby facilitate children's communication were included in meta-analyses. The largest meta-analysis combined data from 316 participants in six studies and the smallest combined data from 55 participants in two studies. Findings from the remaining seven studies were reported narratively. High risk of bias was evident in the studies in relation to allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data; blinding of participants was not possible. Overall, we did not find statistical evidence of gains from parent-mediated approaches in most of the primary outcomes assessed (most aspects of language and communication - whether directly assessed or reported; frequency of child initiations in observed parent-child interaction; child adaptive behaviour; parents' stress), with findings largely inconclusive and inconsistent across studies. However, the evidence for positive change in patterns of parent-child interaction was strong and statistically significant (shared attention: standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.68, P value < 0.05; parent synchrony: SMD 0.90; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.23, P value < 0.05). Furthermore, there is some evidence suggestive of improvement in child language comprehension, reported by parents (vocabulary comprehension: mean difference (MD 36.26; 95% CI 1.31 to 71.20, P value < 0.05). In addition, there was evidence suggesting a reduction in the severity of children's autism characteristics (SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.08, P value < 0.05). However, this evidence of change in children's skills and difficulties as a consequence of parent-mediated intervention is uncertain, with small effect sizes and wide CIs, and the conclusions are likely to change with future publication of high-quality RCTs. Authors' conclusions The review finds some evidence for the effectiveness of parent-mediated interventions, most particularly in proximal indicators within parent-child interaction, but also in more distal indicators of child language comprehension and reduction in autism severity. Evidence of whether such interventions may reduce parent stress is inconclusive. The review reinforces the need for attention to be given to early intervention service models that enable parents to contribute skilfully to the treatment of their child with autism. However, practitioners supporting parent-mediated intervention require to monitor levels of parent stress. The ability to draw conclusions from studies would be improved by researchers adopting a common set of outcome measures as the quality of the current evidence is low.","Early intervention delivered by parents for young children with autism spectrum disorders Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect more than 1% of children and is usually evident in behaviour before the age of three years. A child with ASD lacks understanding of how to interact with another person, may not have developed language or understand other people's communication, and may insist on routines and repetitive behaviours. This early pattern of difficulties is a challenge for parents. Therefore, helping parents to develop strategies for interaction and management of behaviour is an obvious route for early intervention. The present review brings up to date one published in 2003, which found only two well-designed studies. This review, based on a new protocol, includes 17 randomised controlled trials, most published since 2010, in which interventions delivered by parents were compared with no treatment or local services, or alternative child-centred intervention such as nursery attendance, or another parent-delivered intervention that differed in some way from the main condition. We were able to combine outcome information and so increase confidence in the results. All the studies were rated on the quality of their evidence, which was then taken into account in judging how firmly conclusions could be drawn. The studies varied in the content of what parents were trained to do, and over what length of time parents had contact with professionals. Parents received training either individually with their child or in groups with other parents. In the majority of the studies, the interventions aimed to help parents be more observant and responsive during interactions with their child in order to help their child develop communication skills. In summary, the review finds sufficient evidence that the ways in which parents interacted with their children did change as intended. The review also suggests improvement in child outcomes such as understanding of language and severity of autism characteristics as a result of interventions delivered by parents. However, important outcomes such as other aspects of children's language, children's adaptive skills and parent stress did not show change. The evidence is not yet strong for any outcome and would benefit from researchers measuring effects in the same ways.","background Young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have impairments in the areas of communication and social interaction and often display repetitive or non-compliant behaviour . this early pattern of difficulties is a challenge for parents . therefore, approaches that help parents develop strategies for interaction and management of behaviour are an obvious route for early intervention in ASD .

"Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is associated with gene repression and heterochromatin formation. In Drosophila, SU(VAR) 3-9 is responsible for H3K9 methylation mainly at pericentric heterochromatin. However, the histone methyltransferases responsible for H3K9 methylation at euchromatic sites, telomeres, and at the peculiar Chromosome 4 have not yet been identified. Here, we show that DmSETDB1 is involved in nonpericentric H3K9 methylation. Analysis of two DmSetdb1 alleles generated by homologous recombination, a deletion, and an allele where the 3HA tag is fused to the endogenous DmSetdb1, reveals that this gene is essential for fly viability and that DmSETDB1 localizes mainly at Chromosome 4. It also shows that DmSETDB1 is responsible for some of the H3K9 mono- and dimethyl marks in euchromatin and for H3K9 dimethylation on Chromosome 4. Moreover, DmSETDB1 is required for variegated repression of transgenes inserted on Chromosome 4. This study defines DmSETDB1 as a H3K9 methyltransferase that specifically targets euchromatin and the autosomal Chromosome 4 and shows that it is an essential factor for Chromosome 4 silencing.","DNA is the basic unit carrying genetic information. Within the nucleus, DNA is wrapped around an eight-histone complex to form the nucleosome. The nucleosomes and other associated proteins assemble to a higher order structure called chromatin. The histones are mainly globular, excepted for their tails that protrude from the nucleosome core. The amino acids of the histone tails are often modified. For example, several conserved lysine residues can be methylated. Methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 ( H3K9) is important for proper chromatin structure and gene regulation. Here, we characterize Drosophila DmSETDB1 as a histone methyltransferase responsible for H3K9 methylation of the chromosome arms and Chromosome 4. In addition, we show that in the absence of DmSETDB1, silencing of Chromosome 4 is abolished. This study is an important step towards the understanding of the differential chromatin domain specificity and mode of action of H3K9 methyltransferases.","a plain language summary that is easy to read highlighting key points and removing unnecessary details that can be easily understood by non-medical people : Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is associated with gene repression and heterochromatin formation . however, the histone methyltransferases responsible for H3K9 methylations at euchromatic sites, telomeres, and at the peculiar Chromosome 4 have not yet been identified . here, we show that DmSETDB1 is involved in nonpericentric H3k9 recombination , a deletion, and an allele where the 3"
"The H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused substantial morbidity and mortality in humans, first documented in the global pandemic of 1918 and continuing to the present day. Despite this disease burden, the evolutionary history of the A/H1N1 virus is not well understood, particularly whether there is a virological basis for several notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. Using a data set of 71 representative complete genome sequences sampled between 1918 and 2006, we show that segmental reassortment has played an important role in the genomic evolution of A/H1N1 since 1918. Specifically, we demonstrate that an A/H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may also have been associated with reassortant A/H1N1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassortment therefore appears to be a more important process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized.","The periodic occurrence of influenza epidemics in humans caused by viruses of the A/H1N1 subtype remains a key question in viral epidemiology and evolution and a major issue for public health. Since the first documentation of A/H1N1 in humans in 1918, this virus has been associated with a variety of epidemics and influenza vaccine failures. Using 71 representative whole-genome sequences of A/H1N1 influenza virus sampled between 1918 and 2005, we show that reassortment occurs frequently throughout the evolutionary history of this virus. Critically, two of these reassortment events appear to be associated with particularly severe epidemics, those of 1947 and 1951. Our analysis reveals that the virus associated with the 1947 epidemic was composed of genome segments with differing phylogenetic histories, suggesting that this virus was created through an intra-subtype reassortment event. Notably, of the two main antigenic proteins, the segment encoding the HA ( hemagglutinin) is related to isolates circulating in a later time period, while the NA ( neuraminidase) is related to earlier sampled isolates. This explains previous observations that the HA circulating at this time exhibited extensive antigenic drift while the NA appeared to be conserved. In addition, a virus likely associated with the 1951 epidemic also appears to have been generated by a reassortment event. Overall, our findings suggest that reassortment is an important factor in the long-term evolution of influenza A virus, including the periodic emergence of epidemic viruses. However, to more fully capture the evolutionary history of this important virus, additional sequencing of influenza viruses from earlier time periods is clearly needed.","the H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused substantial morbidity and mortality in humans , first documented in the global pandemic of 1918 and continuing to the present day . despite this disease burden, the evolutionary history of the A/H1n1 virus is not well understood , particularly whether there is a virological basis for several notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s . we demonstrate that segmental reassortment has played an important role in the genomic evolution of the virus since 1918 , which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus ."
"Experimental recordings in hippocampal slices indicate that astrocytic dysfunction may cause neuronal hyper-excitation or seizures. Considering that astrocytes play important roles in mediating local uptake and spatial buffering of K+ in the extracellular space of the cortical circuit, we constructed a novel model of an astrocyte-neuron network module consisting of a single compartment neuron and 4 surrounding connected astrocytes and including extracellular potassium dynamics. Next, we developed a new model function for the astrocyte gap junctions, connecting two astrocyte-neuron network modules. The function form and parameters of the gap junction were based on nonlinear regression fitting of a set of experimental data published in previous studies. Moreover, we have created numerical simulations using the above single astrocyte-neuron network module and the coupled astrocyte-neuron network modules. Our model validates previous experimental observations that both Kir4. 1 channels and gap junctions play important roles in regulating the concentration of extracellular potassium. In addition, we also observe that changes in Kir4. 1 channel conductance and gap junction strength induce spontaneous epileptic activity in the absence of external stimuli.","Astrocytes are critical regulators of normal physiological activity in the central nervous system, and one of their key functions is removing extracellular K+. In recent years, numerous biological studies have shown that astrocytic Kir4. 1 channels and gap junctions between astrocytes act as major K+ clearance mechanisms. Dysfunction of either of these regulatory mechanisms may cause generation of K+-induced seizures. However, it is unclear how and to what extent these two K+-regulating processes lead to spontaneous epileptic activity. These questions were addressed in the present study by constructing novel single astrocyte-neuron network models and a coupled astrocyte-neuron module network connected by an astrocyte gap junction based on existing experimental observations and previous theoretical reports. Simulation results first verified that either down-regulation of astrocytic Kir4. 1 channels or a decrease of the gap junction strength between astrocytes causes neuropathological hyper-excitability and spontaneous epileptic activity. These results imply that dysfunctional astrocytes should be considered as targets for therapeutic strategies in epilepsy.","astrocytes play important roles in mediating local uptake and spatial buffering of K+ in the extracellular space of the cortical circuit . we constructed a novel model of a single compartment neuron and 4 surrounding connected astroocytes and including extracellular potassium dynamics . the function form and parameters of the gap junction were based on nonlinear regression fitting a set of experimental data published in previous studies . our model validates previous experimental observations that both Kir4. 1 channels and gap junctions play significant roles in regulating the concentration of extracellular calcium . in addition, we observe that changes in Kir4 1 channel conductance and gaps junction strength induce spontaneous epileptic activity in"
"Native cell-free transcription-translation systems offer a rapid route to characterize the regulatory elements (promoters, transcription factors) for gene expression from nonmodel microbial hosts, which can be difficult to assess through traditional in vivo approaches. One such host, Bacillus megaterium, is a giant Gram-positive bacterium with potential biotechnology applications, although many of its regulatory elements remain uncharacterized. Here, we have developed a rapid automated platform for measuring and modeling in vitro cell-free reactions and have applied this to B. megaterium to quantify a range of ribosome binding site variants and previously uncharacterized endogenous constitutive and inducible promoters. To provide quantitative models for cell-free systems, we have also applied a Bayesian approach to infer ordinary differential equation model parameters by simultaneously using time-course data from multiple experimental conditions. Using this modeling framework, we were able to infer previously unknown transcription factor binding affinities and quantify the sharing of cell-free transcription-translation resources (energy, ribosomes, RNA polymerases, nucleotides, and amino acids) using a promoter competition experiment. This allows insights into resource limiting-factors in batch cell-free synthesis mode. Our combined automated and modeling platform allows for the rapid acquisition and model-based analysis of cell-free transcription-translation data from uncharacterized microbial cell hosts, as well as resource competition within cell-free systems, which potentially can be applied to a range of cell-free synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.","Significance Nonmodel bacteria have essential roles to play in the future development of biotechnology by providing new sources of biocatalysts, antibiotics, hosts for bioproduction, and engineered ""living therapies.

"Platelets drive endothelial cell activation in many diseases. However, if this occurs in Plasmodium vivax malaria is unclear. As platelets have been reported to be activated and to play a role in inflammatory response during malaria, we hypothesized that this would correlate with endothelial alterations during acute illness. We performed platelet flow cytometry of PAC-1 and P-selectin. We measured platelet markers (CXCL4, CD40L, P-selectin, Thrombopoietin, IL-11) and endothelial activation markers (ICAM-1, von Willebrand Factor and E-selectin) in plasma with a multiplex-based assay. The values of each mediator were used to generate heatmaps, K-means clustering and Principal Component analysis. In addition, we determined pair-wise Pearson's correlation coefficients to generate correlation networks. Platelet counts were reduced, and mean platelet volume increased in malaria patients. The activation of circulating platelets in flow cytometry did not differ between patients and controls. CD40L levels (Median [IQ]: 517 [406-651] vs. 1029 [732-1267] pg/mL, P = 0. 0001) were significantly higher in patients, while P-selectin and CXCL4 showed a nonsignificant trend towards higher levels in patients. The network correlation approach demonstrated the correlation between markers of platelet and endothelial activation, and the heatmaps revealed a distinct pattern of activation in two subsets of P. vivax patients when compared to controls. Although absolute platelet activation was not strong in uncomplicated vivax malaria, markers of platelet activity and production were correlated with higher endothelial cell activation, especially in a specific subset of patients.","Endothelial cell activation is a key process in the pathogenesis of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Platelets are classically involved in endothelial cell activation in several diseases, but their role in the context of vivax malaria remains unclear. Thrombocytopenia is the most common hematological disturbance in P. vivax-infected patients, and platelets have been implicated in parasitemia control. In this work, we studied the activation of platelets in association with endothelial cell activation in vivax malaria. Platelets retrieved from infected peripheral blood were non-activated when analyzed by flow cytometry; however, they displayed higher mean volume and significantly reduced counts. We also found higher levels of circulating factors associated with platelet activation ( especially soluble CD40L) , thrombopoiesis and endothelial cell activation in infected patients. Further, through pair-wise correlation and clustering analysis, we found a subgroup of patients showing significant associations between markers of platelet and endothelial activation in a pattern different from that of endemic controls. Collectively, our findings indicate a role of platelets in endothelial cell activation in vivax malaria and indicate a heterogeneous host response in the setting of uncomplicated disease, a finding to be further explored in future studies.","platelets drive endothelial cell activation in many diseases . although platelets have been reported to be activated and to play a role in inflammatory response during malaria , we hypothesized that this would correlate with alterations during acute illness . we performed platelet flow cytometry of PAC-1 and P-selectin . platelet counts were reduced, and mean platelet volume increased in malaria patients . a network correlation approach demonstrated the correlation between markers of platelet activity and production in two subsets of P. vivax patients when compared to controls . the activation of circulating platelets in plasma with a multiplex-based assay"
"Ras-like small GTPases function as molecular switches and regulate diverse cellular events. To examine the dynamics of signaling requires spatiotemporal visualization of their activity in the cell. Current small GTPase sensors rely on specific effector domains that are available for only a small number of GTPases and compete for endogenous regulator/effector binding. Here, we describe versatile conformational sensors for GTPase activity (COSGAs) based on the conserved GTPase fold. Conformational changes upon GDP/GTP exchange were directly observed in solution, on beads, and in live cells by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) . The COSGAs allow for monitoring of Rab1 and K-Ras activity in live cells using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. We found that Rab1 is largely active in the cytoplasm and inactive at the Golgi, suggesting that the Golgi serves as the terminal of the Rab1 functional cycle. K-Ras displays polarized activity at the plasma membrane, with less activity at the edge of the cell and membrane ruffles.","Significance Ras-like small GTPases regulate a wide range of cellular processes involving signal transduction, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and membrane trafficking by switching between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound form.

The COSGAs enable quantitative detection of the GDP/GTP binding state of Rab1 and K-Ras in living cells with spatiotemporal resolution to gain insights into Rab membrane cycling and Ras signaling at the plasma membrane.

"Understanding how the human brain processes auditory input remains a challenge. Traditionally, a distinction between lower- and higher-level sound features is made, but their definition depends on a specific theoretical framework and might not match the neural representation of sound. Here, we postulate that constructing a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features, could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses. We collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film. The raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses. The model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well to a second dataset, where new participants watched a different film. The extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions. Specifically, several features encoded speech-related acoustic properties with some features exhibiting shorter latency profiles (associated with responses in posterior perisylvian cortex) and others exhibiting longer latency profiles (associated with responses in anterior perisylvian cortex) . Our results support and extend the current view on speech perception by demonstrating the presence of temporal hierarchies in the perisylvian cortex and involvement of cortical sites outside of this region during audiovisual speech perception.","A lot remains unknown regarding how the human brain processes sound in a naturalistic setting, for example when talking to a friend or watching a movie. Many theoretical frameworks have been developed in attempt to explain this process, yet we still lack the comprehensive understanding of the brain mechanisms that support continuous auditory processing. Here we present a new type of framework where we seek to explain the brain responses to sound by considering few theoretical assumptions and instead learn about the brain mechanisms of auditory processing with a 'data-driven' approach. Our approach is based on applying a deep artificial neural network directly to predicting the brain responses evoked by a soundtrack of a movie. We show that our framework provides good prediction accuracy of the observed neural activity and performs well on novel brain and audio data. In addition, we show that our model learns interpretable auditory features that link well to the observed neural dynamics particularly during speech perception. This framework can easily be applied to external audio and brain data and is therefore unique in its potential to address various questions about auditory perception in a completely data-driven way.","we postulate that constructing a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features, could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses . we collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film . the raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses.resultsthe extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions . our results support and extend the current view on speech perception by demonstrating the"
